Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren't (having \PhD\ in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That's what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit \expert\.
Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.
For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses.
I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive.

RT  Mars topography 
The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.
Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.
That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
Of course :)
Under consideration. We've already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.
A third is under construction
Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.
A Shortfall of Gravitas

TeslaMotorsClub Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.
TeslaMotorsClub Seriously! Obviously, I'm not going to do an April Fool's joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).
Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn't matter.
Tesla Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I'm sure there's a really great answer ...

Can't believe you're even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what's most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world's most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.
About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we don't design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so I'm back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell ...

Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is 3rd in world after a  place &amp;  mall. Giga will be largest when complete. 
You're most welcome 
The \dry\ questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.
To be clear, I'm a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
First, it's important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while 
Please ignore this thread unless you're interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
Exactly
The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter
We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
Yes, definitely not

Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you're short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit ...

RT SpaceX: Falcon 9 Block 5 first stage has landed on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship. 
Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them.
Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines -- quaint, but not something you'd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general.
Good piece by Ars 
Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over &amp; Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars &amp; eventually outer planets.
If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I can't figure them out.
Lovely story 
Happy Mother's Day Mom! Love you so much.
Fair criticism, but we're fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising.
RT SpaceX: More photos from the first flight of Falcon 9 Block 5 -  
This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.
According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It's not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
It's super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage 
What's actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.
Time will tell, but so far it appears so

Exactly
It's only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing
Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.
Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don't get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.
Good idea ...
Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can't tell
They are correct. It's awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.
Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It's like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there's nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don't want to.
Exactly
Yeah, \Reveal\ was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today's non-union.
Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what's happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.
Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.

Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as \facts\ by Reveal.
Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.

RT  ALL DAY TOMORROW ON   has an exclusive look at SpaceX, including a sitdown with President &amp; COO Gwynne Shotwell. Starting 810amET on  
Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3's have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we've seen anything like this.
Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3's having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
Teslaology   Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.
Stop, you're making me blush [?]
Complexity is the devil. Words can't express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we'll try.
Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little
Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won't stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
ABS calibration algorithm
Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today's Model S is far more refined than initial production.
Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.
Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn't fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
I definitely don't do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can't be creative otherwise.
I didn't meet with him
Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!
They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
More \Reveal\ bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they've never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article ...
No problem
No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class \lords &amp; commoners\ system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
Good point
We're going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?
In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.
But ya know what, let's test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let's hold a vote &amp; find out.

Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he's above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.
RT   Thought you'd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks \You're just like Trump!\ Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.
The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn't advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world's biggest advertisers.
An exception that proves the rule
Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?

Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
Even if some of the public doesn't care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.
We don't. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.

No, they're just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously

Of course
I've never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven't forgotten UAW betrayed them. That's why UAW can't even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
If you're in media &amp; don't want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it ...

Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.

The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car's exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
But don't worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything's just fine 
Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.

19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way...
SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly ...
Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
We don't think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
That's quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents 
20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your  like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?EUR}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company's name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
This is why I'm not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I'd know everything's fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 
Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the \halo crown\ effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don't think there will be another.
Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there's no escaping Newton's Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
Will do
Yes. Hopefully, I'm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
Sigh. This is crux of matter: can't make system too annoying or people won't use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can't allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
Add an R for Roadster 
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
Love this design. Simpler the better.
The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I'm thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
Not recommended for urban environments
Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It's what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust -- literally bulletproof.
Of course, but it's the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we're never going to make them again.

Very appealing if you're a sophomore in college. It's a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness.

Iain certainly wasn't pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn't be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that's a special case.
SpaceX 
SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
UAW doesn't have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can't even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they're getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
I'm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can't compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don't want Tesla to die too.
I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy's claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
...which clearly doesn't work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what's happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they're getting desperate.
TeslaCharts Then you'll be fine
Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
Well said 
TeslaCharts I don't want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.

Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
We've always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.

Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.
That's really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what \money\ is.
He's obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.
Exactly
Great name. A little on the nose.
Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.

Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn't change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.

RT   Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you're in an air tube, time doesn't matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.
SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won't come in

Great, thanks
TeslaBull  Interesting
I would def recommend this
Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
It's open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about in that tweet -- double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.

Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.
I'm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.
Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.
Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. 
Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could've departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.
Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.

Python 
Python is done right. Great name story too.
Tight control code is always C

Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it's on a plane to Thailand
Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.
Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They're prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward
Testing underwater in LA pool 
Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.
I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz ...
With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space
It is an honor to work with them
Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
Thanks  for letting us use your pool
Tube diameter is 31cm
Thanks, but we've not done anything useful yet. It is all other people.
According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages
Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage 
According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage.
Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
That would be cool. I wonder what it's like under all that ice.
Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids' soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. 
Teslamodel3fan Tesla Ok
Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as \rescue chief\) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: 
Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.
Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point
Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.
Ironically, the \billionaire\ label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn't called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed.
Already have
No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?
Exactly
Should be very soon. We've already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
When you're there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?
Please lmk results of your water tests
Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
RT Teslarati: Elon Musk in Shanghai signs prelim agreement for Tesla factory in China with 500k vehicle capacity 
Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it's there for anyone who needs it in future. Something's messed up if this is not a good thing.
I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
Makes a lot of sense
Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.

You're right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they've lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.
Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?

Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.

Water level was actually very low &amp; still (not flowing) -- you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear, which is obv how the kids got in. If not true, then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video. Huge credit to pump &amp; generator team. Unsung heroes here.
Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves. Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Thai navy seals escorted us in -- total opposite of wanting us to leave.
You know what, don't bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.
This will only take a moment
I was *asked* to help repeatedly. Declined several times, as I thought they had it in hand &amp; only agreed to help when Thai SEAL died (deep cave pumps not operating at time). We designed the mini-sub to Stanton's specifications *and* brought a flexible rescue pod just in case.
The Brit expat diver in the video is a dude
I have never donated to a SuperPAC
We were external expert-sourcing the design with experienced cave experts on the Internet. We showed progress videos to iterate with the local dive team.  And ... we certainly didn't lie. Proof will be in the pudding shortly, when we take mini-sub all the way in &amp; out of Cave 5.

A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car

Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at 
Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don't realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.
Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder

Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative -- it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide. 
When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they're just \passive\ managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!

Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm.
Exactly. That's Monday.
Didn't you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don't get that.
Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer
Tesla Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund
It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that.
Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars
Tesla Exactly, this is total bs. What part of \production hell\ sounds like a sure thing!?
It's a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action ...

Teslarati Amazing results by  at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!
Teslarati  Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.
Teslarati  To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.
Teslarati  Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.
Teslarati  Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa &amp; South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020

If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people.
Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3.
RT Teslarati: Tesla's 'Bioweapon Defense Mode' is proving invaluable to owners affected by the ongoing CA wildfires

We know we'll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far ... 
That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for \grant money\. They earn  vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?
Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)
Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.

Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30 
Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it's better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location.
Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently.

Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times. 
It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive.

Investigating
Absolutely agree
Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That's a great van. We will inquire.
Lot on our plate, so it's either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
No, it's got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
No, we're just going to accelerate BFR
Renaming BFR to Starship
Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth's deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)

Tesla history trivia: we didn't actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He'd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. 
Buying  took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn't like  even when we were only making .
Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.
Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn't exist or would have started much later. 
It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.

Tesla in  tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again 
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it's time to upgrade to something better.
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
Presentation starting at 8:15
Precisely
RT  The Boring Company Loop system 
Next step for  Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
RT  The only way to describe my experience going through the new #boringtunnel was EPIC!  solution to solve \soul-crushing\ traffic is one step closer to being a reality.   
I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
Pop up, park and walk!
You're right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn't include it. We're working on one that makes things clear.
Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they're right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
Exactly
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? 
Tesla Autopilot doesn't need the guide wheels. They're only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
RT  Hopped in my Tesla this morning and was delighted to find \romance mode\ and a drop-down list of juicy, on demand fart noises, that can be triggered with a wheel click or turn signal.  The best keeps getting better.  Thanks  and team!

Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we're using a different alloy mix. I super [?] 300 Series Stainless!
I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we're building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April
For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
Exactly
We're building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
Coldformed at cryo
Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word \star\ or \link\ 
Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem.
Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.
You def don't want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That's not a typo.
It's embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant
Thanks!
SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions.

There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc 
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it's electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.

RT  In the second half of 2018, the Model 3 was the fifth best-selling sedan in the U.S.--outsold only by Toyotas and Hondas--despite an average selling price of more than $55k. No other car brought in more revenue in the U.S. 3/  
RT  In the closing weeks of 2018, Tesla's market cap overtook Daimler's as the third most-valuable automaker--they've since gone back and forth--even though Tesla is nowhere close to the revenue, earnings or capital resources of these global competitors 4/

Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
Teslarati I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

Absolutely. You've touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.
Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9
To be clear, I'm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
Yes. It's very rare to find all three.

Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
SpaceX Yes
Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won't need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.

Rocket booster temperatures won't go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

SpaceX About 11 secs
SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
SpaceXFan97  SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
SpaceX Close

The gritty truth ...
4000 Tesla cars loading in SF for Europe 
Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019
Won't be long before they do
&lt;Ahem&gt; I stand corrected. Should have said first half of 2012.
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.
I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes. 
That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don't have any crypto holdings.
Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner
So true  John Clarke 
SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I'm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.
Exactly. That's the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
SpaceX commercial  launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. 
Don't know
Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for \launch capability\. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
That's true  Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing [?]High engine chamber pressure and ablative don't get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.
Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.
Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.
To the first part. I doubt we'd create a Dyson ring or sphere.
SN2 has changes that should help
Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.

Tesla  Still get this question a lot, even though Norway  has highest Tesla cars per person on  (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.
Tesla  Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn't critical for snowy regions.
Tesla  Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that's a lot of complexity.
Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don't actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.

RT Teslarati: Tesla Model 3 owners with the latest 2019.8.2 software update are waking up to even more performance 
First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout ...
Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We're simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
Tesla   Teslainventory Agreed
Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don't need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
Full size
Only some of the hottest sections
Hexagonal tiles on most of windward side, no shield needed on leeward side, transpiration cooling on hotspots
Testing Starship heatshield hex tiles 
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.
SpaceXFan9876      Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.
White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin
Yes, full duration

Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward \HW3\ will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. 
Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it's slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what's there. Not impossible.
Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year's vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.
Annoying that  perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can't. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that's very rare.

Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won't spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn't cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
There is 35 GWh/yr \theoretical capacity\, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3's in Q1 due to cell constraints.
Wow, a lot of people don't know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.

Teslarati poetic justice
Mint berry crunch
Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn't have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.
Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that's a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
Starship is kinda Gundam
Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock  puppets of big oil

Tesla Full Self-Driving 
It's automatic
Tesla Yeah, will post soon
RT Tesla: All Tesla cars being built today have the hardware necessary for full self-driving:   8 vision cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, radar, and this custom-designed beast of a Full Self-Driving Computer 
All cars made since Oct 2016 either have the hardware needed for FSD or are trivially upgradeable
Tesla Exactly
Warning, this presentation is 4 hrs &amp; 20 mins long
Tesla All Model 3's ever made can upgrade
Full Self-Driving video

Tesla Upgrading hardware is not important for a few months
Tesla Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla
Tesla Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone 
RT Tesla: Our new Full Self-Driving Chip houses 6 billion transistors and is capable of processing up to 2300 frames per second - a 21x improvement over previous gen hardware 
Tesla  As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed.
Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
Anti-matter def wins on energy density 
RT Tesla: Tesla Vision uses path prediction to accurately predict how a road will extend, even when it can't see around the corner 
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never ... 
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Over a million combustion engine (it's right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there's a good reason that isn't obvious.
Sad if true 
TeslaownersSV  Thanks, support super appreciated
Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV's have high fire risk when opposite is true.
Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez ...

Tesla Exactly, Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net
Tesla 21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can't transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant.
Tesla Teslarati I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
Tesla NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs.

Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.
Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite 
Chomsky sucks
Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
Depends on destination
Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
Yeah, we've been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
TeslaownersSV  Excessive shades of grey
Anything with high contrast
So cool
Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
SpaceXFan97     Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
It's a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms

Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low
About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
~1000, as all seats would be \coach\ &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It's basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney's Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you'd exit on another continent.
You're touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We're fixing that with Starship.

Motor Trend awards Tesla Model S best Car of the Year ever in their 70 year history!!  
RT Tesla: \No vehicle we've awarded, be it Car of the Year, Import Car of the Year, SUV of the Year, or Truck of the Year, can equal the impact, performance, and engineering excellence that is our Ultimate Car of the Year winner, the 2013 Tesla Model S.\

Tesla Great team
Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues.
~20m up &amp; sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.
We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
Cont of main
100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin th/2, as I recall, but doesn't matter, as there's no geo  anywhere near that mass.
About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at 40%. We'll keep it above 50% for this flight.
Take note
Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs  
RT  Just visited  and absolutely mind-blown with the progress they've made since I was last there two years ago. Check out the livestream on Tuesday to also be mind-blown. (For a full overview of the company, here's my big article on it:

Tesla Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
Tesla Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
Tesla Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
Tesla Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year
Tesla Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off
Tesla Yeah, that's next after summon
Tesla Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.

Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week
No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can't make enough of them &amp; we won't be able to.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
Agreed. That's approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Probably
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
\If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.\ -- Gen Shinseki

Good piece
Tesla  This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features
Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!
Aiming for hover test next week
Post test fuel leak, but no major damage
Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
Maybe end of next year
Tesla Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you'd expect.
Tesla No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot

High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren't hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.
Wearing black not recommended 
Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option

Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
Depot haha
Tesla Fixing ...
Orbital refilling is vital to humanity's future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.
I'm told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
Not sure. Will check with my team.
RT SpaceX: The booster supporting this mission previously flew in support of the Telstar 19 VANTAGE and Es'hail-2 missions 
TeslaClubIN  For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.

Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff ...
Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
But actual road data is what matters most

RT Tesla: When the grid goes down, stored energy in Powerwall means you can:   * keep the lights on  * do your laundry * play videogames instead of taking this rare opportunity to connect with your loved ones. 
For sure
Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
Between $100B and $10T
Tesla Yes
Tesla Powerwall doesn't need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels
Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B
SpaceX Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully &amp; immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly . Even though I'm immersed in Starship/Raptor design &amp; build 7 days/week, it still doesn't feel real.
SpaceX Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes

Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming

Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system's fusion reactor (the sun).

Photoshop is amazing
SpaceXFan97    SpaceXcentric Most likely
SpaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult
SpaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that's not indicative of capability.
SpaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
SpaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It's such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
SpaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there's no weather in space
SpaceXcentric 
SpaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven't moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you'll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you're prob ok.
SpaceXcentric Precisely
SpaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.

Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
Teslatunity  There aren't really meant to be \Tesla incentives\, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
Teslatunity  Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
Teslatunity  Agreed
The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
TeslaownersSV   At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
TeslaownersSV   That's not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I'm looking into it
TeslaownersSV   Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don't raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
TeslaForLife TeslaownersSV   Exactly! We've only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  
However, we won't customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.

RT Teslarati: Tesla Model 3's stellar safety ratings highlighted in fan-made spec 
Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas 
SpaceXFan97 Yes. There's a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven't closed it out.
SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
Stability is not an issue with 3
Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward \fin\ would simply be used as a leg.
Current analysis, which I'm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver.

Just sent a note to check
Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it's worth, he has my support.
RT Tesla: does she ever ask you what you're thinking and you say 'nothing' but you're actually thinking about whether Tesla secretly employs thousands of tiny hamsters to power their cars and it's not batteries at all 
That's correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.
Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating
Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
Teslarati Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car

RT Tesla: Software Version 10.0: Your brand new Tesla is here.  Buckle up, we have a lot to get through [?]
RT  In Bargersville (Indiana, USA). Model 3 was bought by the police instead of the Dodge Charger. The police calculated fuel costs: Dodge requires 7.2 thousand dollars a year for gasoline, while Model 3 needs about 1.7 thousand dollars to charge. The benefit is obvious. 
Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
There's so much power going through this engine that it's close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor -- far more than in design of the engine itself!

Tesla_addicted   Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that's problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you'll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.

Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly ...
Most people aren't aware that orbit (and \zero\ gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. 
Tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!
TeslaownersSV   Tesla_addicted We're working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren't actual parking spaces.
Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
This is true. All that matters is number used in [?]v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. 
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. 
Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
Also, we're keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that's leaving a lot on the table
We def could be wrong about this, but it's actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don't need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines

Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we've only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. 
Great poem
Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
Would be odd to expect anything else

The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it's designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that's a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what's hard.
TeslaownersSV  A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
TeslaownersSV  As the planets align only once every two years
TeslaownersSV  So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
TeslaownersSV  No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That's the sales pitch. Want to go?
TeslaownersSV  Exactly! It's also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).

Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn't consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.

Excellent review by Marques! 
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can't stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
We're creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we'll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can't be made using standard methods.
[?][?] Study the Blade!! [?][?] 
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I'm confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
Really? Ok sure.
Interesting idea
Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too

Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar
Most people still don't know it's there
Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
We're building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone's on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
Future feature
It's not that these things can't be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware.

No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it's getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.
Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.

Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don't try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.

Haha true
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome  
We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
TeslaownersSV   Yeah
No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
We're focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?

Great idea
Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.
A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank -- it's just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don't collapse when depressurized on the ground.

Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!
Fundamental issue with SLS is that it's not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch!  tragedy.
Densification isn't needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it's an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
What's amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.

Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary

The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool.
Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.
This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things 
Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren't being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, they're just several clicks away.
The safest place to hide a dead body is the second page of Google search results!
Haha true
Only 66 years from first controlled, powered flight to landing on the moon. Now, half a century later, we are still unable to return. This must change.
Desperate times call for desperate measures ...
Unfortunately, this is true. It doesn't matter how skilled you are if you're trapped in a giant bureaucracy.
\At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn't just icing on the cake, it the cake\ -    Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI.  
Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with
Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data &amp; efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory &amp; ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later.
We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin
Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon.
Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency
A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI &amp; ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what's truly hard). Don't care if you even graduated high school.
RT  Tesla Is A Touchdown Among  Players, And It's Just Getting Started  [Video] Listen to the real people, they love #Tesla   $TSLA   
Sorry!
The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.
PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.
Probably this summer
Wait until you see the next version vs what was presented last year. It's *awesome*.
TeslaGong    It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don't want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.
TeslaGong    True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
TeslaGong       Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I'm unaware of
Nothing medically dangerous, but 5g is getting a bit too greedy with their spectrum land grab 
Tesla  Ok sure  Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn't be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.
Definitely!
Going max hardcore on design/production Starship here in Boca. It's awesome! Feels a bit like a Mars simulator.
Starship career day at the Stargate building (Boca Chica Blvd, TX) this Thursday from 3pm to 9pm!
This is mainly for staffing up 4 production shifts for 24/7 operations, but engineers, supervisors &amp; support personnel are certainly needed too. A super hardcore work ethic, talent for building things, common sense &amp; trustworthiness are required, the rest we can train.

Teslarati This isn't quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that's 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it's built inside a factory in volume.
Teslarati Yes, we're tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
Teslarati No, they're SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
Teslarati  Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.
You're welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.

Probably 6 months or so. 301 is certainly fine for orbit, but SpaceX 30X will be better.
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.
Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it's very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.
I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
Coming hopefully later this year
Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It's stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don't do it justice.
Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours.
The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics &amp; energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.

Unfortunately, Starship unlikely to survive LEO entry intact without shielding on windward side, but none required on leeward. Even windward shielding is very light.
be still my beating heart  
Shielding is only needed for orbital speeds
Only the heart senses beauty
TeslaownersSV Tesla Will take action
Might be used around flap joints
The joints will have shielding, but it's hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal.

Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km 
All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.
TeslaownersSV Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)
Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
There's a tough performance vs range tradeoff. Plaid has absurd performance, while holding range roughly constant.
Regulations require calling it something else, so we added +
Depends on when car was built, as there are many small hardware improvements, so most will be somewhere in between 373 &amp; 390
X will also improve by a similar amount

Rocket nosecone production in Texas 
The Persuader hammer will fix SN1
SN 2+ will have better fit &amp; weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length.
Worth reading Asimov's Foundation 
In the order that they were written
O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters.
There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.
The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit
High bay for stacking Starship engine bay, propellant tanks &amp; fairing (fka nosecone) sections is almost done! 
I rate it two Bugblatter Beasts of Traal up!
Attach wheels to the landing legs &amp; tow Starship to the launch pad

RT  Tesla Model 3 Is Consumer Reports' Top EV Pick for 2020  
Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
It's mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
Science has gone too far 
Teslarati Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
Teslarati Btw, in some prior tweets I'd said production Cybertruck would be ~80\ wide (vs ~84\ body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82\, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
Definitely worth trying imo
Teslarati It's slightly better
Teslarati Yes, will also show real-time changes to max acceleration, braking, cornering, speed on gradient &amp; range, latter factoring in route elevation changes &amp; cargo or tow mass &amp; drag impact
Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing

We had the wrong settings! To make the welds super flat &amp; strong, we're building a heavy duty, custom planisher, but just having the right settings is a major improvement.
Full disclosure, I'm actually a 3000 year old vampire. It's such a trial assuming all these false identities over the centuries!
Teslarati I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though!

Tesla_truth  Sure

It's not mine
SpaceX Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design
Teslarati It's not that big really
The competitor should be a drone fighter plane that's remote controlled by a human, but with its maneuvers augmented by autonomy. The F-35 would have no chance against it.
I just sent a note to Twitter to clarify that posting SpaceX videos is fine by us and we paid for rights to Bowie song for the Falcon Heavy launch

Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.
Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!
Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!

0% chance of anything close

Some helpful data from Italy 
We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?
Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn't happened already.
SpaceX   Yes
Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: 
No new domestic corona cases in China 
Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.
We're working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
Thanks 
Interesting thread
Yes, we're working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won't be needed
That won't work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can't stay open
Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too
A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
Feels like the plot of Deus Ex 
Important consideration
Do you have data on the false positive rate? I've heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and \presumed positive\. 
Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
Up to 80% false positive
Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. 
Fair point :)
Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
No problem :)
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
RT  Addressing #COVID19 is a group effort. We are grateful for the discussion with  and Tesla as we work across industries to solve problems and get patients and hospitals the tools they need to continue saving lives. We're all in this together. 
We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
Italy: \On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.\
Panic is always dumb
Tesla  You're most welcome. We're working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
Tesla Supply chain logistics -- getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  -- is the main issue we're hearing from ER physicians
Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
Tesla   Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there's anything else you need.
This is great advice
Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
We'll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
Worrisome
Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
Much appreciated

According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.

Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I've seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
Teslarati Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that's quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter
Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you're expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!
Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly

Tesla Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
Tesla Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
Tesla C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
Tesla Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include \estimated illness onset date\. This is a significantly less rigorous standard. 
Tesla Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation
Teslarati Sigh
TeslaownersSV Teslarati Working on that with Medtronic. Given NY pressing needs, we're delivering Resmed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators to NY hospitals starting tonight.
RT  1/ This is a remarkable turn from Neil Ferguson, who led the  authors who warned of 500,000 UK deaths - and who has now himself tested positive for #COVID; 
RT  2/ He now says both that the U.K. should have enough ICU beds and that the coronavirus will probably kill under 20,000 people in the U.K. - more than 1/2 of whom would have died by the end of the year in any case bc they were so old and sick.
RT  3/ Essentially, what has happened is that estimates of the viruses transmissibility have increased - which implies that many more people have already gotten it than we realize - which in turn implies it is less dangerous.
RT  4/ Ferguson now predicts that the epidemic in the U.K. will peak and subside within \two to three weeks\ - last week's paper said 18+ months of quarantine would be necessary. 
RT  5/ One last point here: Ferguson gives the lockdown credit, which is *interesting* - the UK only began ita lockdown 2 days ago, and the theory is that lockdowns take 2 weeks or more to work.

You're most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they're needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.
Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them
Also makes for a great shelter 
Buzzfeed is a mind virus
Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you're immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind. 
Can you do a fast antibody test?
This sounds great
And many doctors are not treating patients, due to fear of giving or receiving C19

Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.
Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who's behind it.

RT  #MDTisMobilizing with  Our collaboration with Tesla / SpaceX is bearing fruit. SpaceX is now making a vital component for critical care #ventilators -- more vents sooner for #COVID19 patients. 
Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.
We're adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you're doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
There are redundant pressure control valves. It's a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.
Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.
Hard to hide anything from the Internet! Yeah, we're going to reuse much of the thrust section.

SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.
Tesla Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
A lot has happened in 8 years
Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.
The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: 
In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.
Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize

Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it's hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they'd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.
Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That's the acid test.
Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.
Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.
Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. 
Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
Tesla The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It's a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!
Tesla Vast majority of \ventilators\ are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient's throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2. 
Tesla Depends on patient lung strength, but, again just my personal opinion, I wouldn't go much above their natural lung pressure
Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially  Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn't scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it's probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
Tesla My (again) personal favorite is 
I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It's very hard. I'm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 
That's for sure! 
SN4 won't get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.
Production is by *far* the hard part. That's why I'm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they're pretty sweet ...
Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.
Interesting
They were, but are they currently?
We're working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington
Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I'm hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
Sounds about right 
TeslaownersSV    A mask or nose \ventilator\ with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you're fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
\Don't jump to intubation.\ -- Dr Caputo 
\Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning\. Yup.
What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
Exactly

I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 
Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!

No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry
No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.

My kids loved that one when they were little
You'd think they'd at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It's very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are \real ventilators\. 
Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as \ventilator\, but makes many good points 
Probably 3 to 6 months
Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter.
I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn't just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind.

Tesla SpaceX  2008 was a super tough year on all levels

Turns on city street intersections is the big one
Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we'll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack.
Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! 
In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid
Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.
Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
It's so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
A great mystery of the universe
Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded
SLS makes me feel sad
A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
Yeah!!
Tesla Way more important than it sounds
Tesla Sure :)
Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator
Teslatino Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms.
Tesla Yes
Tesla Would cover latitude of London
Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 
TeslaownersSV   Probably makes sense to have a \Details\ section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
A mandatory tracing app would be insane
That's pretty much what happened. The cows weren't sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other.
Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.
Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.
It's not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
No, but it's mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)
That's harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
Pain can certainly be turned off, but we're not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet

Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80's as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.
Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
Haha. Will post summary.
Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets 
Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount 
Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories 
Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km 
After which they are recycled 
We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights.
Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.
Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast 
Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I'd call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it's 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration ...

That's the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.
Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that's already mixed.
Tank didn't burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We're developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner \stiffness\, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.
Looking likely

There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.

Also, there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just haven't observed them during humanity's (very short) recorded history. Comet S-L 9 punched a roughly Earth-sized hole in Jupiter. 
The \early investor\ part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I've ever worked with and that's saying something!) for years.
This might sting a little ...
Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there'll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.
Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We'll do lots of flights.
Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! 
SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
That's engine SN. We're building SN8 of the ship.
Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they're actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.

It's counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!

Dojo V1.0 isn't done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
I've been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
I don't want be cavalier, but there isn't an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
Absolutely  
Mostly for employees, but we'll support public access whenever it's safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
We will push for ten flights with Starlink
TeslaTested That's an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.

Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don't need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.

Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That's probably faster.
Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.

Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
People read too much into this level of detail. It's not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level.
SpaceX       Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
SpaceX       Not yet
Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn't blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.
One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.
Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells 
That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I'm headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.
People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.

SpaceX  The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC &amp; differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.
Just go through resonant modes fast. It's when you hang out there that problems arise.
SpaceX  Yeah
SpaceX  Over time, outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust &amp; inner 8 ~210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship

Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration.
Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We'll build several ships just to improve the production system.

For Dojo, we're betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.
Tesla You really want waypoints this much?
Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.

SpaceX  Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.

Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It's 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.

Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that's needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.

I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
They are
Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.
We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can't emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it's fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
TeslaownersSV   Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product

Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   It's already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.

Tesla FSD computer's dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes -- they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.

Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.
Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.   R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn't achieve anything, but I'm confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.

And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.   Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.  GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories.

Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.
But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win
Minor
Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.

That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn't own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.

We lost vehicle pneumatics. Reason unknown at present. Liquid oxygen header tank pressure is rising. Hopefully triggers burst disk to relieve pressure, otherwise it's going to pop the cork.
Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We'll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
If it's happening to me, it's happening to others. I'm getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
Exactly
The carousel turns ever faster
Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so \Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid\ is an equally correct title. The \rapid antigen test\ from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.   False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: 
What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
Interesting
Interesting
Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What's the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
Sure is
From  
Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.
Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
Strange
Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
Note, this is not the spike protein. They don't consider that reliable.
Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not
Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
Soon 
Case closed 
This a great reference! Worth a read.
The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you're probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?

Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
Teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I'm asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it's high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes \positive\.
Worth reading this thread if you're curious about rona testing 
RT   Great question! It's more complex question and depends on why the test is being used - ie: do you want to know if you are currently contagious/risky to others or if you have any remnants of RNA? The difference may sound trivial but it is massive  1/

Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn't work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it's less than 1% of the pain.
We should just count the atoms at this point
The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don't blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.

Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn't matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.
Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!
Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.   What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.
Exactly
Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it's mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year

Tesla Wow
Exciting mission!
Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.
Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip We're still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.
Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip Yes
Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it's probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
Not yet
Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.
Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance
But that's why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
Major upgrades are slated for SN15
This is a subject of much debate
Teslatino   Yes, but only slightly filled
This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal 
The Promise is greatly needed
Haha true
TeslaChillMode    Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically.
Teslaownerssv  TeslaChillMode    Hopefully next month
Happy Thanksgiving!
But actually! 
Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what we're betting on for training with Dojo
Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks
Yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round
For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha
Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.
SpaceX It will have landing legs
Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.
Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights
Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.
It will be real soon
Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX! Some of the best memories ever.
Congrats!

The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue: 
Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great
Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world's most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict.
Sure hope that future doesn't come to pass!
Dankeschon Brandenburg und Grunheide!
Perhaps slightly more confident, but it's essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.
It's a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.
I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare

Tesla   Hi Liz!
Sparta's reply to Macedon
Strange, if true.   - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.  - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?
During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.
Good idea

Tesla Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique -- not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.

Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but that's more of a long-term solution.
Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O --&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.
Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)

Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.

RT SpaceX: Falcon 9 will launch  SPHEREx mission - which will collect data on more than 300 million galaxies and explore how the universe began - from our launch site at Vandenberg AFB as early as June 2024 -  
SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they're already there
SpaceX Higher Isp too
SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
SpaceX That said, the ship landing burn has a clear solution. My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid &amp; full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth.

SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.
Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we don't fail, the cost to end users will improve every year.
Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well, Starlink will IPO

If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but it's getting mature.

Beta V8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.
Doge spelled backwards is Egod
Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding \Download Beta\ button to Service section of car display in ~10 days 
Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing.   Note: word \Beta\ is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.
The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option.
Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems.
The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise).
Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built.

We will ask the regulators
SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.
Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.
Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster
Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it's not a gamechanger.
I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has \spare\ performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
RT SpaceX: Liftoff! 
If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.  A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.   Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
Like  but *with* self-driving haha

When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.
Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar).   Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it.   As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.
Tesla_adri  These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.

SpaceX 69th Raptor engine coming soon
Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI.
Probably late July
Will investigate
Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.  This is a \march of 9's\ trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.
Same timing
Hopefully addressed this summer
Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing.
Insanely cute!

Le Petit Prince
While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.  Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it's hopeless. This is insanely hard.

Great progress by Tesla team
Dragon spacecraft &amp; Falcon 9 rocket 
Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle 
Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half.   Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again.   Doesn't mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.
Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

Your research as a private individual is better than professionals    Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.  Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.

TeslaNY Sandy Munro knows what he's talking about
Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.  Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.
Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery
Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.
Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised.   Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month.   Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.
Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.  In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.
Very important. Most people don't know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.
Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
If Tesla owners are \conspiracy theorists\, then it would be fair to call them \advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers\.   If that's an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths ...
Does seem a little weird
I'm staying at a friend's place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall.   When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don't even flicker. Owner says he doesn't notice.

True. The opposite in fact - I provide financial support to my parents.
An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer, so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)
Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels.   What's really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!
No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.
Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in 2022 &amp; possibly total units in 2023

I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists, rather than publications.   Any given publication is going to have wide range of views, albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative, perhaps reflecting innate human biases.  Citizen journalism FTW!
Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product.   I trust the people.
FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time, I agree with regulators!   On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn't anticipate.
They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo.   Strange that they aren't taking more action on some of the SPACs.

He should wear outfit for Halloween, but with \Bitcoin\ tattooed high on thighs
Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies.   A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound \decentralized\ to you?  
Hey cryptocurrency \experts\, ever heard of PayPal? It's possible ... maybe ... that I know than you realize about how money works.

I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.  This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not.
TeslaGong  Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
TeslaGong  Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition - same as a hardcore roller coaster.
TeslaGong  Ideally 0.1kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate
TeslaGong  Achieving truly decentralized finance - power to the people - is a noble &amp; important goal.   Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo.  For now, Lightning is needed.
Tesla We can't wait to build this crazy truck! It's a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end.
