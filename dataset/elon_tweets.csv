81	Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it's going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience.

187	The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.
188	Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.
189	That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.
190	Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023
191	Of course :)
192	Under consideration. We've already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.
193	A third is under construction
194	Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.

310	You're welcome. Sorry for the delay. Only just got back from Gigafactory. Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.
311	Sounds like this canton has style!
312	Model X pulls a 95,000 lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface 
313	Thanks!
314	No real surface is perfect, but it did pull about 250,000 lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel 
315	Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new 3 imo, unless you want a smaller car.
316	Sorry 
317	That said, Lori deserves a lot of credit for supporting competitive, commercial space launch while under massive assault from old-school monopolists
318	No technology is too advanced for The Boring Company! 
319	I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...
320	Wow, a whole week. Risky ...
321	Umm...yes
322	Inconceivable! Who'd say a thing like that!?
323	What's Facebook?
324	I didn't realize there was one. Will do.
325	Yeah, it's borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in.
326	First time I've seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
327	SpaceX  Literally never seen it even once
328	Maybe that word doesn't mean what I think it does
329	Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
330	Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance.
331	What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!
332	Instagram's probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don't use FB &amp; never have, so don't think I'm some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don't advertise or pay for endorsements, so ... don't care.
333	We've never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
334	You'll live
335	I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness &amp; safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.

365	There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter 14 and a half (the worst one).
366	Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it.

377	TeslaMotorsClub Seriously! Obviously, I'm not going to do an April Fool's joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh).
378	Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?
379	Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn't matter.
380	Tesla Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I'm sure there's a really great answer ...
381	Liftoff in 5 mins 
382	Can't believe you're even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what's most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world's most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.
383	About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng &amp; prod better aligned, so we don't design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so I'm back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell ...

459	You're most welcome 
460	The \dry\ questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.
461	To be clear, I'm a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification
462	They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
463	First, it's important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while 
464	Please ignore this thread unless you're interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
465	Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.
466	The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors
467	Exactly
468	The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter
469	We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.
470	Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.
471	Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
472	True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.
473	It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
474	Yes, definitely not
475	New Roadster will have that
476	Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you're short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit ...

548	RT SpaceX: More photos from the first flight of Falcon 9 Block 5 -  
549	This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.
550	According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It's not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.
551	It's super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage 
552	What's actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
553	It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.

577	Exactly
578	It's only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing
579	Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.
580	Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks
581	Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range
582	Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don't get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
583	Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
584	Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
585	That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
586	Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.
587	Good idea ...

594	Yeah, \Reveal\ was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today's non-union.
595	Exactly ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what's happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
596	About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.
597	That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
598	With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.

606	Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
607	Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.

611	RT  ALL DAY TOMORROW ON   has an exclusive look at SpaceX, including a sitdown with President &amp; COO Gwynne Shotwell. Starting 810amET on  
612	Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.
613	The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3's have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we've seen anything like this.
614	Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3's having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers
615	Teslaology   Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.
616	Stop, you're making me blush [?]
617	Complexity is the devil. Words can't express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we'll try.
618	Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little
619	Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won't stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.
620	ABS calibration algorithm
621	Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.
622	Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
623	To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today's Model S is far more refined than initial production.
624	Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.
625	Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn't fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.
626	I definitely don't do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can't be creative otherwise.
627	I didn't meet with him
628	Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!
629	They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.
630	More \Reveal\ bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they've never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article ...
631	No problem
632	No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class \lords &amp; commoners\ system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.
633	Good point
634	We're going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?
635	In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.
636	But ya know what, let's test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let's hold a vote &amp; find out.

655	RT   Thought you'd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks \You're just like Trump!\ Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.
656	The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
657	Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn't advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world's biggest advertisers.
658	An exception that proves the rule
659	Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?
660	Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda ...
661	Exactly
662	Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army
663	Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
664	Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
665	Even if some of the public doesn't care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.
666	We don't. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
667	RT   Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army

673	Of course
674	I've never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven't forgotten UAW betrayed them. That's why UAW can't even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.
675	If you're in media &amp; don't want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it ...
676	Yeah, I think you do great work
677	Thank you! I thought it was so obvious ...
678	Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.

691	Teslanomicsco I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good
692	Teslanomicsco But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right.
693	Teslanomicsco Tesla Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved
694	That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didn't work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.
695	I did to any who asked
696	Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt.
697	Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don't realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.

707	Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven't been unveiled yet. You don't have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches.

850	Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus 
851	RT  We're opening our doors for social media users to come behind-the-scenes for the next SpaceX cargo launch to the International  currently targeted for late June. Apply to attend this #NASASocial event at  in Florida:  
852	Tesla Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3.
853	Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen &amp; particulate of almost any kind 
854	Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little  on S/X.
855	That sounds like a fun adventure!
856	You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel &amp; it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.

858	RT  'Unboxing' my new Tesla Model 3  
859	Some details on the Tesla air filtration system 
860	Glad you're ok! 
861	The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
862	Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car's exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy.
863	But don't worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels &amp; everything's just fine 
864	Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability.
865	Actually true!
866	Usually, they don't even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so.

874	Tesla Next year
875	Twitter is so dark ...
876	Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won't offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value.
877	Definitely
878	Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It's a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week's.

902	RT Tesla: Switching 1 million cars from diesel to electric would save over PS360 ($483) million per year in health costs in the UK
903	No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars.
904	Running track in SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this 
905	And we're definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
906	Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form ...
907	SpaceX Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter
908	Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
909	Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.

913	I think so :)
914	Teslamarcus1 Coming soon
915	Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher.   Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
916	Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty \match\ to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.
917	Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: \Not a Flamethrower\.

919	RT Tesla: Tesla's 10000th Supercharger is now open in Belleville, Ontario:  
920	19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way...
921	SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly ...
922	Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further.
923	We don't think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k.
924	More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
925	At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps &amp; calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages &amp; business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading &amp; real estate apps.
926	That's quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents 
927	20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory &amp; a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your  like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?EUR}%$&amp; fetch_joystick_state function.
928	In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company's name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony.
929	This is why I'm not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I'd know everything's fine &amp; no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 
930	Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.
931	Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features.
932	Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the \halo crown\ effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.
933	You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don't think there will be another.
934	Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.
935	Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there's no escaping Newton's Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.
936	Will do
937	Yes. Hopefully, I'm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.
938	A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
939	Sigh. This is crux of matter: can't make system too annoying or people won't use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can't allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.
940	Add an R for Roadster 
941	It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
942	Love this design. Simpler the better.
943	The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I'm thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda.
944	Not recommended for urban environments
945	Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons
946	Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It's what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust -- literally bulletproof.
947	Of course, but it's the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet &amp; anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing &amp; we're never going to make them again.
948	Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
949	Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
950	That is actual footage
951	Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered: 
952	Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly.
953	Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean \slight up or downward force on the wheel\, not really \hold the wheel\
954	Yes, interface will change with Version 9 software

959	RT  Green lights to Malibu 
960	My \pay\ is in options, which only matter if stock goes up &amp; I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education &amp; environment on Earth w my foundation. Just don't want us to be sad about the future. 
961	Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.
962	My donations are anonymous
963	Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. It's pretty simple &amp; mostly influenced by Douglas Adams &amp; Isaac Asimov.
964	Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon

968	The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape &amp; size of those streams.
969	Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time. 
970	Strongly disagree. I love humanity.
971	What is your utopia?
972	What is yours?
973	A socialist
974	Those who proclaim themselves \socialists\ are usually depressing, have no sense of humor &amp; attended an expensive college. Fate loves irony.
975	Marx was a capitalist. He even wrote a book about it.
976	Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs
977	Socialism vs capitalism is not even the right question. What really matters is avoiding monopolies that restrict people's freedom.
978	There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption &amp; wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation.

985	By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all.
986	\No sense of humor\ is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  Answer: That's not funny!!
987	RT  i was put on this earth for one purpose. that purpose is to kill elon musk 
988	You're a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
989	Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line ... 
990	Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good.
991	Might actually be his!
992	Very appealing if you're a sophomore in college. It's a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness.
993	That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
994	If I'm not a communist, why do I make red cars  
995	I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies 
996	If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks
997	All of them, especially Surface Detail
998	The mind sacrificing itself in the final ship battle
999	Direct democracy by the people. Laws must be short, as there is trickery in length. Automatic expiration of rules to prevent death by bureaucracy. Any rule can be removed by 40% of people to overcome inertia. Freedom.

1009	Fair point
1010	SpaceX Structures, engines, avionics, guidance &amp; control software, new alloys, space lasers (ooh, maybe I shouldn't have said that) ...
1011	Love you too 
1012	SpaceX SX 300 &amp; soon SX 500. Kind of a modern version of Inconel superalloys. High strength at temperature, extreme oxidation resistance. Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine.
1013	Iain certainly wasn't pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn't be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that's a special case.
1014	SpaceX 
1015	SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult.
1016	I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.
1017	UAW doesn't have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can't even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they're getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.
1018	I'm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can't compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don't want Tesla to die too.
1019	I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.
1020	Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy's claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
1021	TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
1022	Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.
1023	More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
1024	...which clearly doesn't work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what's happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they're getting desperate.
1025	TeslaCharts Then you'll be fine
1026	Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.
1027	Well said 
1028	TeslaCharts I don't want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past.
1029	You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That's a very bigoted position.
1030	You're just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I'd fail &amp; be back in 3 months.
1031	Iron pyrite
1032	Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
1033	Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware.
1034	Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?
1035	Wow, you know nothing &amp; are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldn't care less.
1036	Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx's \notes\. Less reliable.
1037	\Profit\ just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years &amp; we're almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt.
1038	They don't seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
1039	They started it &amp; attacked me personally
1040	Search UAW and \corruption\. Very long reading list. Great organization. 
1041	I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America.
1042	Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show.
1043	We've always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties.
1044	Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
1045	Can't wait for the new  season to start!
1046	Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I'm driving.
1047	They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
1048	Thanks, good advice
1049	You won't find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
1050	Your union brothers 
1051	Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can't even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer.
1052	You're welcome, bad fiction writer 78 
1053	Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much [?]
1054	RT   Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much [?]
1055	They also poured the concrete &amp; built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it's way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
1056	It's actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable &amp; a great view of the mountains.
1057	Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
1058	Tesla  Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
1059	They look beautiful

1081	To be clear, Tesla European Headquarters will remain in Netherlands
1082	Thank you for helping those in need 
1083	Cool video 
1084	Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.
1085	That's really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what \money\ is.
1086	He's obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.
1087	Exactly
1088	Great name. A little on the nose.
1089	Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
1090	Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.
1091	Because honey is a vegetable
1092	Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn't change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
1093	Today. It's kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
1094	There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That's still ~40 people.

1286	Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was \dancing her face off\ with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? 
1287	They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don't use Facebook.

1291	RT   Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
1292	Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
1293	Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you're in an air tube, time doesn't matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.
1294	Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
1295	So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.
1296	SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
1297	Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.
1298	Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.
1299	So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won't come in

1303	TeslaBull  Interesting
1304	I would def recommend this
1305	Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
1306	Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.
1307	It's open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
1308	Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.
1309	Yeah, that's what I'm talking about in that tweet -- double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.
1310	Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.
1311	Good idea

1325	Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation.
1326	Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could've departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future.

1335	Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front &amp; rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure.
1336	Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They're prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
1337	Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.
1338	Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.
1339	It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward

1364	No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?

1372	This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it's there for anyone who needs it in future. Something's messed up if this is not a good thing.

1374	It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
1375	Makes a lot of sense
1376	Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue.

1388	You're right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they've lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.

1444	Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand (sus) at any point when we were in the caves. Only people in sight were the Thai navy/army guys, who were great. Thai navy seals escorted us in -- total opposite of wanting us to leave.
1445	You know what, don't bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.
1446	This will only take a moment
1447	I was *asked* to help repeatedly. Declined several times, as I thought they had it in hand &amp; only agreed to help when Thai SEAL died (deep cave pumps not operating at time). We designed the mini-sub to Stanton's specifications *and* brought a flexible rescue pod just in case.

1817	Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.
1818	Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

1866	There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators
1867	Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don't realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.
1868	Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder
1869	The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam

1877	Only if they're extremely tiny
1878	Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative -- it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide. 
1879	When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they're just \passive\ managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!

1929	Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you.
1930	You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Don't have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
1931	About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth &amp; half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens &amp; we destroy ourselves

1947	Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance. 
1948	This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.
1949	Still a long way to go
1950	To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.
1951	I believe it's $5k
1952	~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
1953	Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
1954	The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
1955	Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you're one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day.
1956	Insightful article by David  
1957	Just reviewed Tesla's service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
1958	Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
1959	Yes, aiming for next few months
1960	True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.

2235	Investigating
2236	Absolutely agree
2237	Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That's a great van. We will inquire.
2238	Lot on our plate, so it's either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.
2239	What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.
2240	In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast
2241	No, it's got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.
2242	Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
2243	Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster
2244	No, we're just going to accelerate BFR

2453	You're right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn't include it. We're working on one that makes things clear.
2454	Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they're right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.

2492	This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
2493	Coldformed at cryo
2494	Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
2495	Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word \star\ or \link\ 
2496	Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem.
2497	Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
2498	Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.
2499	You def don't want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That's not a typo.

2701	Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

2825	Rocket booster temperatures won't go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
2826	Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!

2838	Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by SpaceX engine/test team! 
2839	SpaceX Definitely! It's amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
2840	SpaceX About 11 secs
2841	SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
2842	SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
2843	SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
2844	SpaceXFan97  SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
2845	SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
2846	SpaceX Close
2847	SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there's a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9
2848	SpaceXFan97   SpaceX Yes
2849	SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I'm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.

2897	Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019
2898	Won't be long before they do
2899	&lt;Ahem&gt; I stand corrected. Should have said first half of 2012.
2900	Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.
2901	I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes. 
2902	That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don't have any crypto holdings.
2903	Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
2904	Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner
2905	So true  John Clarke 
2906	SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I'm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.
2907	Exactly. That's the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
2908	SpaceX commercial  launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. 
2909	Don't know
2910	Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for \launch capability\. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
2911	That's true  Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
2912	Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing [?]High engine chamber pressure and ablative don't get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
2913	We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done
2914	Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
2915	Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
2916	You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
2917	Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.
2918	Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.
2919	Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.
2920	To the first part. I doubt we'd create a Dyson ring or sphere.
2921	SN2 has changes that should help
2922	Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.

3074	Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. 
3075	Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
3076	We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.

3107	We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference -- about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
3108	However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
3109	Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldn't have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn't afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.

3159	First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.
3160	Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
3161	Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout ...
3162	Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We're simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
3163	Tesla   Teslainventory Agreed
3164	Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
3165	You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
3166	We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don't need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.

3251	Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year's vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.

3440	Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time
3441	Starting May 1
3442	Something like that
3443	Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months
3444	Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won't spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
3445	Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
3446	Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
3447	There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
3448	Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn't cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
3449	Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
3450	There is 35 GWh/yr \theoretical capacity\, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3's in Q1 due to cell constraints.
3451	Wow, a lot of people don't know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
3452	Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop.

3454	Teslarati poetic justice
3455	Mint berry crunch
3456	Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn't have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.
3457	Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that's a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
3458	Starship is kinda Gundam
3459	Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock  puppets of big oil
3460	True, Bloomberg is almost as bad
3461	Tesla Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
3462	I'm sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can't *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expose pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they're all angels ...

3564	Tesla  As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed.

3569	Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
3570	Over a million combustion engine (it's right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
3571	Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
3572	When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there's a good reason that isn't obvious.
3573	Sad if true 
3574	TeslaownersSV  Thanks, support super appreciated
3575	Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV's have high fire risk when opposite is true.
3576	Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez ...

3626	We're working on it. Takes time to get all regulatory approvals. Almost there for the larger US states. At least 6 to 12 months for Europe/UK.
3627	Tesla Exactly, Tesla &amp; Nvidia numbers described by Pete were max *usable* teraops running our vision net
3628	Tesla 21 TOPS for Xavier. Pegasus is just Xavier with a power hog GPU on a separate board. Problem is you can't transfer data fast enough between computer &amp; GPU, so GPU usable TOPS is almost irrelevant.
3629	Tesla Teslarati I think it will be something like that. Much more productive to manage a fleet of robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.
3630	Tesla NVIDIA is a great company, but we needed (essentially) a dedicated ASIC for vision-based driving, whereas their solution needs to serve many different customer needs.
3631	Quantum mechanics was harder than all my other courses combined, but so incredible

3799	Tesla   Yeah, feels like something is messed up with Apple news app. Almost only ever shows negative news. Nickname is \the hate stream\ 
3800	This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters. 
3801	Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways. 
3802	Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels
3803	No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of.
3804	It technically could, but wouldn't have enough mass margin for a heat shield, landing propellant or legs, so not reusable

3829	Did it for the memes 
3830	SpaceX Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower.
3831	SpaceX Yes
3832	SpaceX But, essentially, the spinning things
3833	SpaceX The turbine also spins though. Partially combusted gas drives the turbine wheel, which is attached to a shaft that turns the inducer &amp; impellers.
3834	Boring Company starts digging Vegas tunnel in 2 months. Aiming to finish by end of year. 
3835	SpaceX About to complete SN5, ramping to an engine every 3 days this summer
3836	SpaceX Mk1 &amp; Mk2 ships at Boca &amp; Cape will fly with at least 3 engines, maybe all 6
3837	SpaceX After the GoT finale, we dropped it to 6
3838	SpaceX 3 sea level optimized Raptors, 3 vacuum optimized Raptors (big nozzle)
3839	SpaceX Aspirationally
3840	SpaceX Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.
3841	SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
3842	SpaceX Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth
3843	SpaceX  Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you'd have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
3844	SpaceX  Yes
3845	Two tunnels about a mile long each
3846	SpaceX Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees
3847	SpaceX Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
3848	SpaceX Hopefully, 4 months
3849	SpaceX 3 months
3850	So it goes
3851	SpaceX First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
3852	SpaceX Horizontally
3853	SpaceX Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber.
3854	SpaceX ~2.8m
3855	SpaceX Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move
3856	SpaceX Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full.
3857	RT  Very exciting. Prior to 2019.16.2 my car could not take this exit on its own.   Further, With AP on the ramp, it would panic and tell me to take over as it couldn't pic a lane.   Today the car handled the whole situation! Well done Tesla and   #tesla #NavOnAP #Autopilot

3880	Boring Company guide to why tunnels are awesome &amp; safest place to be in an earthquake 
3881	Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It's optional!
3882	That would great!
3883	LA has a subway, but most people don't know about it
3884	Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
3885	SpaceX  Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!
3886	Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn't matter
3887	Opposite is true: you can have 100's of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below
3888	Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
3889	Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
3890	Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
3891	TeslaTn Yes, 3 to 6 months

3908	SpaceX Yes
3909	TeslaownersSV Tesla Whoa cool 
3910	SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.
3911	SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
3912	Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
3913	SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.

3915	RT Teslarati: Tesla Model S Performance (P100D) refresh sets 1/4-mile record fresh from the factory 
3916	SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
3917	SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won't be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. 
3918	SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that's easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.  
3919	SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
3920	SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
3921	SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
3922	SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we'll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
3923	Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We'll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
3924	SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
3925	RT Teslarati: First look at Tesla's adaptive suspension for the Model S and X refresh  
3926	SpaceX True. I'm a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.

3931	Teslatunity   Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights
3932	SpaceXNow   Exactly. We're on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
3933	SpaceXNow   Not bad
3934	SpaceXNow   Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn't affect schedule much though.
3935	SpaceXNow   Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.
3936	SpaceXNow   Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.

4115	For sure moon 1st, as it's only 3 days away &amp; u don't need interplanetary orbital synchronization
4116	Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.
4117	Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
4118	More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
4119	Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
4120	Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite 
4121	Chomsky sucks
4122	Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
4123	Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
4124	Depends on destination
4125	Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
4126	Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
4127	Yeah, we've been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
4128	TeslaownersSV  Excessive shades of grey
4129	Anything with high contrast
4130	So cool
4131	Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
4132	SpaceXFan97     Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
4133	Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
4134	It's a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
4135	All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms

4180	Probably sooner
4181	Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
4182	Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
4183	There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
4184	That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low
4185	About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
4186	~1000, as all seats would be \coach\ &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It's basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
4187	That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney's Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you'd exit on another continent.
4188	You're touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We're fixing that with Starship.

4310	RT  It's finally here: the full story on Neuralink. I knew the future would be nuts but this is a whole other level.  
4311	Tesla Great team
4312	Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues.
4313	~20m up &amp; sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.
4314	We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
4315	Cont of main
4316	100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
4317	More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin th/2, as I recall, but doesn't matter, as there's no geo  anywhere near that mass.
4318	About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at 40%. We'll keep it above 50% for this flight.
4319	Take note
4320	Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs  
4321	RT  Just visited  and absolutely mind-blown with the progress they've made since I was last there two years ago. Check out the livestream on Tuesday to also be mind-blown. (For a full overview of the company, here's my big article on it:  
4322	Tesla Ok
4323	Tesla  Agreed, it's a small, but important, feature
4324	Tesla Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
4325	Tesla Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
4326	Tesla Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
4327	Tesla Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year
4328	Tesla Will trace back inertial measurements &amp; wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off
4329	Tesla Yeah, that's next after summon
4330	Tesla Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.

4345	Presentation streaming live from  at 8pm Pacific
4346	Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.
4347	If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week
4348	No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
4349	Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can't make enough of them &amp; we won't be able to.
4350	Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
4351	Agreed. That's approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
4352	Probably
4353	As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
4354	\If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.\ -- Gen Shinseki
4355	Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP

4363	Is there a longer edit I can post?
4364	RT  We've released a preprint with additional scientific detail on our devices for domain experts who want to know more. You can find it on bioArxiv: \An integrated brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels\ 
4365	Neuralink surprise twist! 
4366	Thoughtful analysis. We will endeavor to provide the robots, chips &amp; software to academia.
4367	yes, security is extremely important

4373	Good piece
4374	Tesla  This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features
4375	Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!
4376	Aiming for hover test next week
4377	Post test fuel leak, but no major damage
4378	Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
4379	Maybe end of next year
4380	Tesla Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you'd expect.
4381	Tesla No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot
4382	This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket &amp; space station technology. Great respect.

4459	Tesla Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish she'd made it up to sky city
4460	Ability to stream YouTube &amp; Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats &amp; surround sound audio.
4461	When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving
4462	Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound

4492	Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
4493	Depot haha
4494	Tesla Fixing ...
4495	Orbital refilling is vital to humanity's future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.
4496	I'm told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
4497	Not sure. Will check with my team.
4498	RT SpaceX: The booster supporting this mission previously flew in support of the Telstar 19 VANTAGE and Es'hail-2 missions 
4499	TeslaClubIN  For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.

4669	Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
4670	True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
4671	Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system's fusion reactor (the sun).

4801	SpaceXcentric Sea level Raptor's vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle
4802	Photoshop is amazing
4803	SpaceXFan97    SpaceXcentric Most likely
4804	SpaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult
4805	SpaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that's not indicative of capability.
4806	SpaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
4807	SpaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It's such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
4808	SpaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there's no weather in space
4809	SpaceXcentric 
4810	SpaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven't moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you'll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you're prob ok.
4811	SpaceXcentric Precisely
4812	SpaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.

4863	Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
4864	Teslatunity  There aren't really meant to be \Tesla incentives\, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
4865	Teslatunity  Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
4866	Teslatunity  Agreed
4867	The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
4868	TeslaownersSV   At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
4869	TeslaownersSV   That's not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I'm looking into it
4870	TeslaownersSV   Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don't raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
4871	TeslaForLife TeslaownersSV   Exactly! We've only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
4872	Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  
4873	However, we won't customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.

4949	RT Teslarati: Tesla Model 3's stellar safety ratings highlighted in fan-made spec 
4950	Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas 
4951	SpaceXFan97 Yes. There's a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven't closed it out.
4952	SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
4953	Stability is not an issue with 3
4954	Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward \fin\ would simply be used as a leg.
4955	Current analysis, which I'm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
4956	For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
4957	Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
4958	Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver.

4971	RT Tesla: does she ever ask you what you're thinking and you say 'nothing' but you're actually thinking about whether Tesla secretly employs thousands of tiny hamsters to power their cars and it's not batteries at all 
4972	That's correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.
4973	Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
4974	It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating
4975	Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
4976	Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
4977	Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
4978	For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.

5018	Probably around 6 or 7pm
5019	No, we've been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we'll get around to it, but not needed for flight.
5020	RT Tesla: Software Version 10.0: Your brand new Tesla is here.  Buckle up, we have a lot to get through [?]

5022	Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
5023	There's so much power going through this engine that it's close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
5024	Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor -- far more than in design of the engine itself!

5141	Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there's a delay. Other countries are supportive.
5142	Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.
5143	Tesla_addicted   Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that's problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
5144	When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you'll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
5145	V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
5146	Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid

5185	Most people aren't aware that orbit (and \zero\ gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
5186	Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
5187	To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. 
5188	Tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!
5189	TeslaownersSV   Tesla_addicted We're working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren't actual parking spaces.
5190	Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
5191	This is true. All that matters is number used in [?]v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. 
5192	Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. 
5193	Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
5194	Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
5195	Also, we're keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that's leaving a lot on the table
5196	We def could be wrong about this, but it's actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don't need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
5197	Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
5198	Conservation of energy tells you the answer
5199	Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines

5201	Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
5202	Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I've ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
5203	So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It's insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you ...

5242	Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!
5243	That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!
5244	Transparent aluminum is a real thing! 
5245	Srsly 
5246	Haha true
5247	Tesla Will start at ~2:15. Sorry for slight delay.
5248	Tesla Solarglass roof 
5249	Yes, wight destruction guaranteed or your money back!
5250	Jerome is great! Tesla team in general is the strongest its ever been.
5251	Tesla Yes, you can walk on the Tesla Solarglass roof. In stilettos, if you want  
5252	Physics facts 
5253	Sandwich time travel is the only explanation 
5254	RT  This day nine years ago Tesla opened its factory in Fremont. Tesla started production with 1,000 workers. Today, more than 10,000 employees work at the Fremont factory. Here is  inaugurating the factory  such a crazy ride! #fremontBirthday 
5255	Thanks to everyone at Tesla who worked so hard over the years to make our Fremont factory successful!
5256	Took my son to play piano for the seniors home in Pasadena. It was lovely to see them smile [?]
5257	Tesla Sure
5258	Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery backup for 24/7 clean energy &amp; no blackouts at 
5259	US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time
5260	TeslaownersSV Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
5261	Extremely high
5262	TeslaownersSV I'd recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
5263	Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important.  
5264	So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
5265	Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
5266	If you're directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
5267	We don't make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot
5268	Unfortunately, it's hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to  to add solar to an existing roof &amp;  for a new roof with integrated solar.
5269	I hate advertising
5270	Very true. Glass doesn't burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
5271	Tesla We're changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc
5272	Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
5273	Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
5274	RT  As one owner said, \Quality is measured in different ways.\ Notwithstanding initial flaws, they raved about their cars. A near-unanimous 99.6% of respondents said the Model 3 is a pleasure to drive. It's hard to find such consensus over anything really  5/ 
5275	Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees
5276	For Treebeard
5277	\I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.\
5278	Just a reminder that the Tesla Full Self-Driving option goes up by $1000 at midnight on Nov 1 for all regions that have Smart Summon. Order your car online at 
5279	TeslaownersSV If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you're home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if that's in wide release yet, but def in early access. It's an awesome feature.
5280	True, my name literally means tree
5281	TeslaownersSV That's significantly improved in current production
5282	Soon, SpaceX will launch  astronauts to  
5283	Hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess
5284	[?] snacks [?] 
5285	TeslaStars Tesla ...
5286	Haha true
5287	The fires are all too real
5288	Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
5289	Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar! 
5290	TeslaNY Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
5291	Teslarati Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there's a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.
5292	Teslarati Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong
5293	Tesla Solarglass vs   Happy Halloween!! 
5294	Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called \Low Gear\!
5295	Not sure about good of Twitter
5296	Reddit still seems good
5297	Going offline
5298	Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we've only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. 
5299	Great poem
5300	Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
5301	That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
5302	Would be odd to expect anything else
5303	More to come
5304	Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
5305	Teslarati Fair point. Coming soon. We're making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
5306	Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called \Pitch Day\ &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don't buy APCs. It's the Air Force.
5307	RT SpaceX: Static fire test of Falcon 9 complete--targeting 11/11 for launch of 60 Starlink satellites from Pad 40 in Florida
5308	RT SpaceX: The fairing supporting this mission previously flew on Falcon Heavy's Arabsat-6A mission 
5309	Teslarati Naturally
5310	Teslarati The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF
5311	Teslarati Yes
5312	Teslarati Looking into it
5313	Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
5314	The date is strangely familiar ... 
5315	Of course!
5316	RT Teslarati: Tesla receives top scores in Moody's Carbon Transition Assessment 
5317	Extremism is so fun! ( 
5318	Gas/diesel cars too
5319	The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
5320	Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it's designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
5321	If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that's a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
5322	Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
5323	No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what's hard.
5324	TeslaownersSV  A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
5325	TeslaownersSV  As the planets align only once every two years
5326	TeslaownersSV  So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
5327	TeslaownersSV  No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That's the sales pitch. Want to go?
5328	TeslaownersSV  Exactly! It's also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
5329	TeslaownersSV  Pretty much
5330	Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn't consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
5331	SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
5332	Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
5333	RT  Tencent Auto Editor in chief Chang Yan is the first one in  to test drive China-made #Model3. As a model 3 owner himself (delivered back in March), he has a lot to say about the good qualities of his test vehicle. It handles well, smooth, quick, and noticeably quiet. He is impressed. 
5334	RT  2020 Tesla Model 3 beats Hyundai IONIQ to become most efficient EV produced  by  
5335	141 MPGe! 
5336	Same goes for digital super intelligence denial
5337	Bad logic is always ugly
5338	Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species
5339	Exactly

5371	Cybertruck unveil Thursday night 
5372	Surprisingly common
5373	Exactly! Well said.
5374	Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.
5375	I'd be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It's like a kid's drawing.
5376	Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
5377	Teslarati Even Toyota, who made the Prius. That is sad.
5378	TeslaownersSV Teslarati Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
5379	It certainly does
5380	Cephalopods have a strange intelligence
5381	The China space industry is very impressive
5382	78% of people want to gentrify Mordor

5386	TeslaTested So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence ...
5387	Maybe won't need a key at all
5388	SpaceX Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different.

5420	With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement
5421	Haha v true
5422	Excellent review by Marques! 
5423	Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can't stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press
5424	Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
5425	Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
5426	We're creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we'll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can't be made using standard methods.
5427	[?][?] Study the Blade!! [?][?] 
5428	Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I'm confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
5429	Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
5430	Really? Ok sure.
5431	Interesting idea
5432	Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too
5433	The body panels will actually be laser cut!
5434	Can be wrapped in any color!
5435	Good question. It's a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.
5436	Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year
5437	RT  Each second, 1.5 million tons of solar material shoot off the Sun into space. The magnetosphere shields Earth, but the solar wind can get in near the poles and disrupt satellite, radio &amp; GPS signals. 3 new missions aim to improve this technology problem:  
5438	Tesla We should def make it good to hang out there
5439	TeslaOwnersofMA  Tesla In general, this is something Tesla should do
5440	Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesn't cost crazy money for ~3mm skins
5441	Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill 
5442	Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn't bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time ...
5443	Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
5444	Bring it on 
5445	Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.
5446	Agreed, this will be exciting to see!
5447	Sure, will aim to do this next week
5448	Tesla We'd be happy to help
5449	Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls 
5450	Def not dainty

5455	Tesla Touche
5456	With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details. 
5457	It's a generational thing
5458	They are dead to me
5459	Tesla  Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel.
5460	That's why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control

5492	Teslarati Tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
5493	Teslarati Tesla_raj That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
5494	Teslarati Tesla_raj There will be no loss of either

5544	TeslaownersSV I think we can improve that with a little software optimization
5545	TeslaownersSV Yes, just costs a few thousand dollars &amp; is more complex than a board swap. Bunch of connectors &amp; antennas need to change. We can improve the speed a little with software optimization, which might be enough.

5611	Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar
5612	Most people still don't know it's there
5613	Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
5614	We're building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
5615	Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home.
5616	Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone's on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!
5617	Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all.
5618	Future feature
5619	It's not that these things can't be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware.

5629	That would be a fringe benefit

5631	These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only -- no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.
5632	No, he's still much faster 
5633	TeslaownersSV  Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects

5643	We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro &amp; ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy -- he is greatly missed).  My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced &amp; round would've happened anyway.

5645	This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom's cousin's farm in Saskatchewan &amp; a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship &amp; debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton &amp; Stanford.
5646	Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I've ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone.

5656	Thousands of anon/troll/bot accounts suddenly on the attack. Interesting.
5657	For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net.
5658	That might have something to do with it. \Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar\ was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they'd listened to Lenin's last wish, much tragedy may have been averted.
5659	No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it's getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.
5660	Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
5661	Pretty much
5662	Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them.
5663	Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don't try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.

5669	Tesla Ok
5670	TeslaownersSV  Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn't critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!

5681	muffin or not-muffin
5682	Haha true
5683	Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome  
5684	We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.
5685	Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.
5686	Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.
5687	TeslaownersSV   Yeah
5688	No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor
5689	Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.
5690	Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
5691	We're focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
5692	Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?

5751	Great idea
5752	Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight.
5753	A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
5754	Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.
5755	Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank -- it's just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don't collapse when depressurized on the ground.

5784	Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!
5785	Fundamental issue with SLS is that it's not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch!  tragedy.
5786	Densification isn't needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it's an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed
5787	What's amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.

5906	The crypto scam level on Twitter is reaching new levels. This is not cool.
5907	Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse &amp; ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement.
5908	This was a huge problem for search engines until Google applied the citation relevance principle aka PageRank, among many other things 
5909	Trolls/bots just need to be deemphasized relative to probable real people who aren't being paid to push an agenda or scam. Google still shows bs/scam pages, they're just several clicks away.

5916	Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with
5917	Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets

5925	The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks.
5926	Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.
5927	PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
5928	Yeah, it looks like a medieval torture device, but is nonetheless currently used in many human studies! Not hard to be way better.

5931	TeslaGong    It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don't want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.
5932	TeslaGong    True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature
5933	TeslaGong       Intuitively, that should be straightforward to address, but there could be complexities I'm unaware of
5934	Nothing medically dangerous, but 5g is getting a bit too greedy with their spectrum land grab 
5935	Tesla  Ok sure  Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn't be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.
5936	First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.

5970	Teslarati This isn't quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that's 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.
5971	Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it's built inside a factory in volume.
5972	Teslarati Yes, we're tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area
5973	Teslarati No, they're SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.
5974	Teslarati  Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.

5997	Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.
5998	Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
5999	Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering. This pic is brand new.
6000	No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it's very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.
6001	I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!
6002	Coming hopefully later this year
6003	Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home
6004	Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It's stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don't do it justice.

6060	SN 2+ will have better fit &amp; weld quality. Later serial numbers will use bigger stampings, so much less weld length.
6061	Worth reading Asimov's Foundation 
6062	In the order that they were written
6063	O2 header tank is tip of nosecone, CH4 header is in the main CH4 tank
6064	Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal. Pressurized volume is still ~1000 cubic meters.
6065	There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.
6066	The whole nose tip has to have heat shielding for atmospheric entry at Mach 25+ anyway, so is effectively already insulated well in orbit

6071	RT  Tesla Model 3 Is Consumer Reports' Top EV Pick for 2020  
6072	Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
6073	These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
6074	Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main.
6075	It's mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.
6076	F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!
6077	Science has gone too far 
6078	Teslarati Active ride height &amp; active damping are game-changing for a truck or any car with a high max/min weight ratio
6079	Teslarati Btw, in some prior tweets I'd said production Cybertruck would be ~80\ wide (vs ~84\ body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82\, but come standard with upper laser blade lights.
6080	Definitely worth trying imo
6081	Teslarati It's slightly better

6146	Thanks for taking us through this today. Hopefully, such horrors will never again be repeated in reality.
6147	Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe!
6148	Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses &amp; other colds in general population is very high!

6240	Monitor graph at bottom of CDC website. New \confirmed\ cases, not oft-reported \presumptive positive\ is trending to level off over next few weeks &amp; be negligible by end of April. Same pattern as China.  
6241	Some helpful data from Italy 
6242	We will make ventilators if there is a shortage
6243	Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?
6244	Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn't happened already.
6245	SpaceX   Yes
6246	Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs
6247	Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: 
6248	No new domestic corona cases in China 
6249	Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April
6250	Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.
6251	Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.
6252	We're working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter
6253	China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai
6254	Thanks 
6255	Interesting thread
6256	Yes, we're working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won't be needed
6257	That won't work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can't stay open
6258	Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too
6259	A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk
6260	Feels like the plot of Deus Ex 
6261	Important consideration
6262	Do you have data on the false positive rate? I've heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and \presumed positive\. 
6263	Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.
6264	Up to 80% false positive
6265	Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. 
6266	Fair point :)
6267	Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world
6268	Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.
6269	No problem :)
6270	Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
6271	RT  Addressing #COVID19 is a group effort. We are grateful for the discussion with  and Tesla as we work across industries to solve problems and get patients and hospitals the tools they need to continue saving lives. We're all in this together. 
6272	We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
6273	Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors
6274	Italy: \On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.\
6275	Panic is always dumb
6276	Tesla  You're most welcome. We're working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
6277	Tesla Supply chain logistics -- getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time  -- is the main issue we're hearing from ER physicians
6278	Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed &amp; operating is the harder part.
6279	Tesla   Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there's anything else you need.
6280	This is great advice
6281	Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.
6282	We'll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.
6283	Worrisome
6284	Have you seen more data on HCQ &amp; Z-Pak? Hard to find.
6285	Much appreciated
6286	Engineering ftw
6287	According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.
6288	Exactly
6289	TeslaownersSV     Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:

6291	Teslarati Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I've seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
6292	Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond
6293	Teslarati Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.
6294	Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that's quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter
6295	Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize
6296	Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you're expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.
6297	Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!
6298	Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly

6307	Tesla Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.
6308	Tesla Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
6309	Tesla C19 testing in the US over the past week has grown much faster than C19 positive cases. I think we may have passed the inflection point for US cases (excluding NY) already.
6310	Tesla Something weird happened at CDC yesterday. They changed the graph to include \estimated illness onset date\. This is a significantly less rigorous standard. 
6311	Tesla Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.

6315	RT  1/ This is a remarkable turn from Neil Ferguson, who led the  authors who warned of 500,000 UK deaths - and who has now himself tested positive for #COVID; 
6316	RT  2/ He now says both that the U.K. should have enough ICU beds and that the coronavirus will probably kill under 20,000 people in the U.K. - more than 1/2 of whom would have died by the end of the year in any case bc they were so old and sick.
6317	RT  3/ Essentially, what has happened is that estimates of the viruses transmissibility have increased - which implies that many more people have already gotten it than we realize - which in turn implies it is less dangerous.
6318	RT  4/ Ferguson now predicts that the epidemic in the U.K. will peak and subside within \two to three weeks\ - last week's paper said 18+ months of quarantine would be necessary. 
6319	RT  5/ One last point here: Ferguson gives the lockdown credit, which is *interesting* - the UK only began ita lockdown 2 days ago, and the theory is that lockdowns take 2 weeks or more to work.

6325	You're most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way.
6326	Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they're needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.
6327	Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.
6328	We will give away all our ventilators, whether we buy them or build them
6329	Also makes for a great shelter 
6330	Buzzfeed is a mind virus
6331	Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you're immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind.

6343	Teslarati  The legs extend &amp; telescope out, so are longer than they seem, but not as long as they will be for SN4+
6344	We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device &amp; shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or Tesla know.
6345	SpaceX  Mass of initial SN ships will be a little high &amp; Isp a little low, but, over time, it will be ~150t to LEO fully reusable
6346	Tesla Happy we could be helpful! More available if needed.
6347	Y has next-level upgrades, especially body castings &amp; heat pump
6348	Interesting
6349	Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke &amp; ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds.
6350	Definitely need a wider span
6351	Exactly
6352	Will call when we reach Mars
6353	Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.
6354	Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.
6355	Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.
6356	Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who's behind it.

6386	RT  #MDTisMobilizing with  Our collaboration with Tesla / SpaceX is bearing fruit. SpaceX is now making a vital component for critical care #ventilators -- more vents sooner for #COVID19 patients. 
6387	Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.
6388	We're adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
6389	If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you're doomed anyway, so might as well go all in
6390	There are redundant pressure control valves. It's a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
6391	Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.
6392	Exactly. No point in an abort system on Mars, so got to make the core ship super safe.

6450	Tunnels aren't required for this, but might be the only realistic way to solve for downtown to downtown travel
6451	Tragedy
6452	SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.
6453	Tesla Good talking to you too. It was an honor.
6454	A lot has happened in 8 years
6455	Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible.
6456	The swivel wing design was cool. This seems like a good idea: 
6457	In the future, it will be as strange to have expendable rockets as it would be to have expendable airplanes today. All will be reusable.
6458	Particulate matter from automotive exhausts has a much more serious impact on health than most people realize
6459	Yes, this is a real problem. The science is not in doubt.
6460	Correct
6461	Turns out that gun is for the toilet paper 
6462	Tesla It's not turned on. Meant for vandalism monitoring in a robotaxi future. Also, the car has transparent windows, so spying has limited value.

6469	There's a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A.
6470	In case it's not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs
6471	We stole that from cheetahs
6472	This will happen
6473	Giga Berlin will have world's most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature
6474	There's tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!
6475	You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
6476	Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
6477	To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it's hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop
6478	True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they'd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.
6479	Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That's the acid test.
6480	Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.
6481	Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!
6482	Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!
6483	Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%.
6484	Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. 
6485	Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.
6486	Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch
6487	Tesla The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!
6488	Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It's a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!
6489	Tesla Vast majority of \ventilators\ are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient's throat &amp; driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2. 
6490	Tesla Depends on patient lung strength, but, again just my personal opinion, I wouldn't go much above their natural lung pressure
6491	Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially  Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn't scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it's probably right move for small LEO vehicle.
6492	Tesla My (again) personal favorite is 
6493	I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It's very hard. I'm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 
6494	That's for sure! 
6495	SN4 won't get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.
6496	Production is by *far* the hard part. That's why I'm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they're pretty sweet ...
6497	Tesla Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
6498	We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty.
6499	Interesting
6500	They were, but are they currently?
6501	We're working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
6502	I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington
6503	Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I'm hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
6504	Sounds about right 
6505	TeslaownersSV    A mask or nose \ventilator\ with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you're fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable.
6506	\Don't jump to intubation.\ -- Dr Caputo 
6507	\Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning\. Yup.
6508	What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
6509	Exactly
6510	. please fix this misunderstanding
6511	I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. 
6512	Not to mention Medtronic, who makes the most advanced ventilators in the world, also affirming our help!  
6513	So true
6514	Interesting
6515	Perhaps you are unaware that Twitter has a search function? The hospitals *themselves* acknowledged receipt of ventilators.
6516	Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators 
6517	These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment
6518	Yeah, super messed up
6519	Karma is real
6520	We're working on increasing dynamic air suspension travel for better off-roading. Needs to kick butt in Baja.

6523	TeslaGong   Reduced size by ~3%, center line is more level &amp; lower window sill height
6524	TeslaGong   Reviewing overall system with vehicle engineering team next week. Should have number then.
6525	Teslacharts It's a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but it's the future we should have
6526	Teslarati Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.
6527	Good progress, but 18 years to launch our first humans is a long time. Technology must advance faster or there will be no city on the red planet in our lifetime.  
6528	Exactly
6529	Tesla Will do
6530	Flaps, actuator &amp; static aero are undergoing redesign for mass reduction &amp; simplicity

6539	Similar, but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects
6540	No, oxygen header tank in nose is important to keep center of mass forward during atmospheric entry
6541	No, as the header tanks are quite small relative to main (~30 tons vs 1200 tons). Only uses very tip of the nose.
6542	Raptor is going through many development tests. Merlin is doing acceptance tests, as the design is stable. Depending on how you count them, there are about 6 engine stands operating in parallel.
6543	You're welcome! Very exciting times ahead for space.
6544	Tesla The way it should be!
6545	Congratulations again! Starfleet begins ...
6546	My kids loved that one when they were little
6547	You'd think they'd at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It's very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are \real ventilators\. 
6548	Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as \ventilator\, but makes many good points 
6549	Probably 3 to 6 months
6550	Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
6551	Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter.
6552	I sure hope so! This will inspire the world &amp; get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn't just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind.
6553	SpaceX 10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.

6633	Sure, we can probably do an update later this year
6634	Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation.
6635	Definitely
6636	Progress is good
6637	Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
6638	SpaceX It's also because of the Spitfire engine &amp; wizard
6639	As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it
6640	Great labeling tools &amp; talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools &amp; infrastructure is underrated.
6641	These won't be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
6642	Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.

6789	Levitt rocks
6790	TeslaownersSV  Yeah, definitely a future feature
6791	This is false. JD's team put out \video evidence\, but conveniently excluded the date stamp, as it was well after JD &amp; AH had separated.
6792	That would be awesome
6793	Science is simply rigorous pursuit of truth. Quality of reasoning is all that matters, which means a ten-year-old could be more correct than a physics Nobel Prize winner.

6814	Tesla SpaceX  That was the whole company back then. Grew organically from a simple mariachi party in El Segundo.
6815	Good for them! About half the US will be mostly open by this weekend.
6816	Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That's why.
6817	Tesla SpaceX  2008 was a super tough year on all levels
6818	His son sounds great btw
6819	Not SpaceX
6820	Yes. Static fire feeding from fuel header vs main tank.
6821	Turns on city street intersections is the big one
6822	Flare stack flamed out. In a few weeks we'll be recondensing methane using solar power, so no flare stack.
6823	Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! 
6824	In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid
6825	Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life.
6826	Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!
6827	It's so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
6828	A great mystery of the universe
6829	Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine
6830	No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded
6831	SLS makes me feel sad
6832	A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.
6833	Yeah!!
6834	Tesla Way more important than it sounds
6835	Tesla Sure :)
6836	Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator
6837	Teslatino Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms.
6838	Tesla Yes
6839	Tesla Would cover latitude of London
6840	Franz and I do have absurdly similar tastes 
6841	TeslaownersSV   Probably makes sense to have a \Details\ section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.
6842	A mandatory tracing app would be insane
6843	That's pretty much what happened. The cows weren't sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other.
6844	Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.
6845	Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
6846	Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)
6847	To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.
6848	It's not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.
6849	No, but it's mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)
6850	That's harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
6851	Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
6852	Pain can certainly be turned off, but we're not sure what the best initial test case (max goodness for least risk to patient) would be quite yet
6853	Operating on a prime directive of crash avoidance, it could automatically intervene when crash probability is approaching 100%
6854	Yes, this is a high priority
6855	Coming soon
6856	It's true
6857	SpaceX   Glad we could help

6863	Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant \Interim Health Officer\ of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!
6864	Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.
6865	San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.
6866	Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.
6867	Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.

7139	Wow, this is extremely important!! 
7140	Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.
7141	Absolutely
7142	Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.

7149	RT SpaceX: Starlink fairing deploy sequence 
7150	Tesla (Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative &amp; political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad &amp; angry. That's why they're being crushed by  Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article: 
7151	Tesla  Yes
7152	Tesla  Good point!
7153	Tesla  Maybe I should retweet the top four or five point. What caught your eye the most?
7154	Tesla  We shall see ...
7155	Wort reading the whole thing 
7156	Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80's as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.
7157	Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage
7158	Haha. Will post summary.
7159	Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets 
7160	Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount 
7161	Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories 
7162	Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km 
7163	After which they are recycled 
7164	We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights.
7165	Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.
7166	Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast 
7167	Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I'd call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.
7168	Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it's 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration ...
7169	SpaceX      [?] the laser beam long exposure shots
7170	Sure. That's long montage 
7171	Actually, we're on SN30 for Raptor
7172	Great point. Many articles are retweeted based on headlines that don't match the content.
7173	Catapults are a great way to get somewhere fast

7176	TeslaTruckClub Worth considering

7179	It's getting Biblical
7180	I got the fuel cell question about 8000 times
7181	Staggeringly dumb
7182	I thought this was an Onion article
7183	Battery industry is world champion at bs. \Lithium-ion\ doesn't really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great.
7184	Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane. In the same way, a giant reusable rocket flight is way cheaper than a tiny expendable rocket that can be used only once.

7189	RT SpaceX: Falcon 9 launches 58 Starlink satellites and 3  Skysats to orbit before returning to Earth and landing on a droneship 
7190	SpaceXStarlink SpaceX It will get even simpler. Just two instructions for Starlink: plug in &amp; point at sky. Can be done in either order.
7191	SpaceXStarlink SpaceX Around 20ms. It's designed to run real-time, competitive video games. Version 2, which is at lower altitude could be as low as 8ms latency.
7192	SpaceXStarlink SpaceX Sure
7193	Accurate
7194	That's the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.
7195	Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that's already mixed.
7196	Tank didn't burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We're developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.
7197	Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner \stiffness\, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.

7328	There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.

7359	very true
7360	Seems fishy
7361	As you'd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.
7362	In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.

7531	Teslarati Cute
7532	SpaceX     Mass to orbit is a more accurate metric than # of launches, although should be orbit-adjusted (eg GTO&gt;LEO), which would increase competitor mass numbers

7537	TeslaAircraft  Tesla Exactly
7538	SpaceX      To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don't lie.
7539	SpaceX Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in &amp; give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky.

7541	Population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after AI imo
7542	Great work by Tesla software engineering
7543	Trying to set a good example haha. Mars needs people!
7544	This thing we call \money\ is just a (slow, lossy &amp; unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor &amp; necessitate UBI.
7545	SpaceX Small note: latch on post near base is gone &amp; powered Ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version

7798	Teslarati Apart from failing to quarantine elderly/at-risk people early (a mistake they recognize), they were right
7799	Teslarati  Ok
7800	It will look crazy tall with booster &amp; fairing at 122m / 394 ft
7801	I think we can get (Veloci)Raptor T/W on par with Merlin. Latter also started out with about half its current T/W.
7802	Haha, good catch. Booster will have fixed legs that add ~2m in height.
7803	Yeah, full name of engine is Velociraptor or Raptor for short
7804	Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies.
7805	That bs was pushed by oil &amp; gas interests to distract people from the $5 *trillion* per year they receive in subsidies. Bernard Sanders is a docile puppet of big oil! 
7806	And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when we're doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news? 
7807	I wonder if he reads his Twitter feed
7808	RT  Videos like this will always amaze me...  Astronomer Jan Koet captured this video in 2007 of Saturn appearing behind the Moon. Nothing like seeing the movement of planetary bodies through space to remind us that we're living in a Solar *System*  Source:  
7809	Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3.
7810	Also true
7811	RT  Spot the tiny humans!!! This shot really puts it into scale!!! A full blown Starship and SuperHeavy will be hard to fathom!!!! 
7812	Clearly
7813	Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg &amp; other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple &amp; easy -- many per day.

7820	SN7 will be new alloy test tank taken to burst pressure. SN8 will have body flaps &amp; nosecone.
7821	Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending.
7822	Teslarati A little toastier each flight
7823	Teslarati Aiming to make it super fun!
7824	Teslarati No surprise
7825	Sorry to hear this. What can we do to help?
7826	Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails.
7827	Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; \space power\. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money.
7828	I generally try my best not to be on patents
7829	Nobody would suggest buying airplanes that only fly once &amp; then crash into the ocean. That would be absurd ...
7830	So why is this madness acceptable for Boeing/Lockheed rockets?
7831	You are correct. This is a substantial underpayment compared to what ULA has received.
7832	SpaceX     Starship fairing will actually have more height than shown here. Dome will be flatter &amp; more of tip is accessible. Usable volume ~1000 cubic meters.
7833	Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term. 
7834	Teslarati This is important
7835	SpaceX    Yes, integrated with the tip of the nose
7836	Psyche 
7837	Impressive
7838	RT  NEWS:  &amp; SpaceX are targeting no earlier than Oct. 23 for Crew Dragon's first operational mission to the  with   Shannon Walker and  pending certification following a successful Demo-2 test flight.  
7839	Teslarati Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production
7840	Teslarati The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point.
7841	What are the odds ... ?
7842	H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel
7843	Significant improvements coming to S/X air suspension soon via software update! Will simultaneously improve performance handling &amp; ride comfort &amp; enable user customization of height &amp; damping, geocoded for relevance.
7844	Teslarati More software improvements coming
7845	Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It's a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting.
7846	The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it's a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks.
7847	This is what I meant by \4D\ 
7848	TeslaownersSV  Not perfectly at first, but yes. Will take maybe a year or so to get really good at roundabouts worldwide. The world has a zillion weird corner cases.
7849	Yes! We're labeling bumps &amp; potholes, so the car can slow down or steer around them when safe to do so.
7850	TeslaownersSV  Sorry, this is embarrassingly late. Two factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now.
7851	TeslaownersSV  Also definitely coming haha. Will only be on relatively recent cars, as we didn't have an outside speaker until about a year ago. Can change inside sound easily.
7852	TeslaownersSV Exactly

7859	TeslaownersSV Ok
7860	Absolutely, but it doesn't seem that govt can move fast enough
7861	Tesla Your insights over the years have been excellent. That's approximately right.
7862	Tesla Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not.
7863	Tesla Dojo is still being built. Maybe a year or so from V1.0.
7864	TeslaownersSV    Tesla A lot of work remains. Technically, we have it working in sim with FPGAs at ~0.01% capability. This will be a true supercomputer.
7865	hasty govt 
7866	Tesla This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators.

7891	Also, there could be long period comets that intersect Earth right now. We just haven't observed them during humanity's (very short) recorded history. Comet S-L 9 punched a roughly Earth-sized hole in Jupiter. 
7892	The \early investor\ part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I've ever worked with and that's saying something!) for years.
7893	This might sting a little ...
7894	Very impressive render. Note, legs will be bigger &amp; there'll be way more stuff in engine bay. Main engines actually do majority of work in turning ship vertical before landing.
7895	Yeah, Starship will be a tiny dot at 20km. Hard to see with naked eye. We'll do lots of flights.
7896	Raptor engine just reached 330 bar chamber pressure without exploding! 
7897	SN40 is about to be tested &amp; has several upgrades over 330 bar engine. For reference, 330 bar on Raptor produces ~225 tons (half a million pounds) of force.
7898	That's engine SN. We're building SN8 of the ship.
7899	Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons &amp; min is ~90 tons, so they're actually quite similar. Both Merlin &amp; Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner &amp; Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.

7908	Yeah, will post shortly
7909	Aloha, welcome back from space  
7910	My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut.
7911	Teslarati We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers!
7912	Yes, it will have huge nuts haha
7913	Payload reduction due to reusability of booster &amp; fairing is &lt;40% for F9 &amp; recovery &amp; refurb is &lt;10%, so you're roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3
7914	RT Tesla: Big updates in    - Trans-Canada Supercharging   - Model Y deliveries   - Leasing for Model Y &amp; Model 3  
7915	It's counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!
7916	Elevator music is underrated
7917	Scorcher VI 
7918	Dojo V1.0 isn't done yet. About a year away. Not just about the chips. Power &amp; cooling problem is hard.
7919	I've been working in Boca since Sunday. August heat &amp; humidity in South Texas is intense! If you think of it like a tropical resort, that makes it better though.
7920	I don't want be cavalier, but there isn't an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.
7921	Absolutely  
7922	Mostly for employees, but we'll support public access whenever it's safe &amp; secure. Public support is critical to making life multiplanetary.
7923	Almost never need to replace whole engine, but some individual parts like turbine wheels need to be replaced over time. Similar to a jet engine.
7924	We will push for ten flights with Starlink
7925	TeslaTested That's an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.
7926	Absolutely needs liquid cooling. We're applying our experience cooling half megawatt drive unit power electronics in cars to computers.
7927	Not having long chain hydrocarbons &amp; lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference

7950	Starship/Super Heavy, which is ~10X mass of Zenit, will mostly launch from ocean spaceports long-term
7951	400 Wh/kg *with* high cycle life, produced in volume (not just a lab) is not far. Probably 3 to 4 years.
7952	I tried to warn them, but they just dug their own grave twice as fast!
7953	On it
7954	Yeah. Occasional flights from land are ok, but frequent (daily) flights probably need ~30km / 18 miles clear area for noise.
7955	Orbital launch mount
7956	Tesla_addicted  No &amp; not possible at this scale
7957	Not exactly GPUs for NN. Lots of cores optimized for dot products with fast local memory &amp; super high bandwidth between cores &amp; efficient liquid cooling. Compiler needs to be optimized too.
7958	Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don't need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately.
7959	It's almost working reliably
7960	Perhaps one day there will be an ocean on the northern part of Mars
7961	There's a lot of frozen CO2 &amp; H2O on Mars. Heating the planet will densify the atmosphere. It's solvable.
7962	Now I want candy
7963	Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That's probably faster.
7964	Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day.

7986	That number sure comes up a lot 
7987	They're quite accurate!
7988	Neuralink this month &amp; Tesla next month, SpaceX probably October. We will have made a lot of progress by then. Might have a prototype booster hop done by then.

7991	Good chance something will slip, but, yeah, Sunday is intense
7992	Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

8007	SpaceX        Booster design has shifted to four legs with a wider stance (to avoid engine plume impingement in vacuum), rather than six
8008	SpaceX We can't have a blanket pass, but maybe for some events
8009	Critical feedback is always appreciated btw
8010	People read too much into this level of detail. It's not useful for predicting the future, nor can we ourselves accurately predict what issues we will encounter on a short-term, fine-grained level.
8011	SpaceX       Yes. This is the hardest part of the booster design.
8012	SpaceX       Not yet
8013	Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn't blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval.
8014	One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was.
8015	Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low &amp; symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells 
8016	That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I'm headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas.
8017	People are extremely unlikely to die of Covid/sars-cov2 alone. If you have multiple pre-existing health conditions &amp; a weak immune system, then you have significant mortality risk from many diseases (not just Covid/sars-cov2) that would otherwise have minor effect.
8018	It is unfortunately common for many in academia to overweight the value of ideas &amp; underweight bringing them to fruition. For example, the idea of going to the moon is trivial, but going to the moon is hard.

8041	SpaceX  The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC &amp; differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.
8042	Just go through resonant modes fast. It's when you hang out there that problems arise.
8043	SpaceX  Yeah
8044	SpaceX  Over time, outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust &amp; inner 8 ~210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship

8085	Sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll figure it out though. Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard.
8086	He has no clue
8087	And this still isn't using the dramatically better \4D\ (aka simultaneous surround video from 8 cameras) architecture
8088	Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks.
8089	All frames stitched to single frame (tricky, as all cameras overlap in different ways) &amp; then creating video segments for labeling &amp; training. Everything from the labeling tools themselves to training to inference had to be rewritten.
8090	Yes. Good insight.
8091	Exactly. Problems like that have been addressed.
8092	Can someone do a boat service from South Padre to Boca?
8093	SN8 Starship with flaps &amp; nosecone should be done in about a week. Then static fire, checkouts, static fire, fly to 60,000 ft &amp; back.
8094	One way or another, excitement guaranteed! Support of greater Boca, Padre, Brownsville community is very much appreciated.
8095	SpaceXcentric  SpaceX Anyone tracking tonnage to orbit per year for all launch vehicles?
8096	SpaceXcentric  SpaceX That's the number that really matters
8097	SpaceXcentric  SpaceX Cumulative mass to orbit per year (corrected for GTO &amp; other high energy orbits) is the best comparative metric imo
8098	I'm wearing your F-1 engine shirt right now!
8099	The Story of Civilization. First book is a little dry, but second book, The Life of Greece, is incredible. 
8100	The LEGO Movie was awesome
8101	Ancient Greece had it all &amp; then committed suicide. Nobody digs your grave better than yourself.
8102	Seems like they should make a whole outfit out of that material
8103	Definitely not. Smartwatches &amp; phones are yesterday's technology, Neuralinks are the future.
8104	Teslavibes Couldn't agree more -- major software improvements are already in place to extend its life &amp; more coming
8105	Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration.
8106	Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We'll build several ships just to improve the production system.
8107	Tunnels are the solution to traffic. You can have as many levels as you want. Usable tunnel depth far exceeds tallest buildings, so would work even for New York or Beijing.
8108	Embrace tunnels!
8109	Gary the snail is still winning, but we're gaining on him/her
8110	Exactly
8111	Good analysis
8112	Have you hugged a tunnel today?

8120	Tesladri   Should be happening soon
8121	Doubles as an underground nuclear shelter  
8122	There are some eerie parallels between The Boring Company &amp; Vault-Tec. We also built our first demonstration tunnel/vault in LA.
8123	Fallout Radio   
8124	Great idea!
8125	Implicit conflation of consumption &amp; capital allocation is the foundational error
8126	Fallout Shelter is on your Tesla. Tap the Entertainment button.
8127	No, but you make some great points. Important to note that iron's cost advantage is partly offset by increased pack mass, so the fully considered cost is closer to nickel. That said, iron alleviates much of the scaling problem.
8128	Speedrunning Factorio in real life ...
8129	Teslarati It will be very insane
8130	Lot has happened in 13 years
8131	Current was too strong for droneship to hold station. Thrusters to be upgraded for future missions.
8132	Good movie
8133	Sure, but which planet?
8134	of course I still love you
8135	Irrational is such a funny word to describe numbers
8136	To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me.
8137	It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero
8138	TeslaownersSV   Felt I had done enough on the Internet (Zip2 &amp; PayPal) that my work would be useful to others. Needed to get going on accelerating sustainable energy &amp; making life multiplanetary.
8139	If you feel Neuralink might have incorrectly overlooked your resume or declined to  make an offer, please lmk in comment below 
8140	A prior track record of exceptional achievement in engineering *is* required, but *no* prior experience working on the brain or human physiology is required. We will teach you what's known about the brain, which is not much tbh.
8141	Shaped like a diamond &amp; aligned on true north
8142	There'll be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The \open\ areas inside are covered. They're internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building.
8143	For Dojo, we're betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.
8144	Tesla You really want waypoints this much?
8145	Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.
8146	There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.
8147	Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs
8148	It's big
8149	Pretty much any machine-learning
8150	TeslaownersSV    Ok
8151	Custom ultra high speed bus &amp; efficient cooling
8152	I'm pretty sure Tesla could do a much better autocorrect. The bar is so low haha.
8153	Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature
8154	Fine, we'll do it already 
8155	SpaceX  Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.
8156	SpaceX  We really need better legs for Starship. They're coming.
8157	Thanks!
8158	Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
8159	We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.
8160	The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It's 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
8161	RT  We drove a Model S Long Range Plus for 422.7 miles in California and believe we could have made it to 430. Tesla explained how they're killing it on range:  
8162	Tesla Haha
8163	TeslaownersSV cgi irl
8164	That's about right. Maybe a little faster.
8165	We will be a little below that this year (most challenging year we've ever had), but probably above that next few years
8166	Thanks for your many years of support through very tough times!
8167	Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster &amp; Semi C A R S 
8168	Probably
8169	Tesla Roadster will be better
8170	SpaceX Haha

8172	Pretty much
8173	Jets are so cool
8174	Maybe I will ...
8175	Haha true

8180	107 expansion ratio. You can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle.
8181	Yeah, but might not need it
8182	What can't we predict?
8183	Genetic engineering is too slow unless you use a synthetic virus
8184	Or energy &amp; time, but besides that what?
8185	Where is our prediction of probability inaccurate?
8186	Preburners ignite, then main chamber
8187	Doesn't seem to be a problem. We could probably increase area ratio, given 330 bar max demonstrated chamber pressure.
8188	There are some practical size constraints too. Can't be too big to fit in the engine compartment. But, it could be a little bigger. 380 sec Isp would be nice.

8200	Starship SN8 with rear body flaps 
8201	Nosecone &amp; front flaps next week. SN9 next month.
8202	First flight is to 15km or ~50,000 ft
8203	We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach.
8204	8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It's enough. Improvements in work.
8205	Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, we're making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.
8206	That species has stood the test of time
8207	Fun with time travel 
8208	There are times when I feel like I'm living in a Dilbert cartoon
8209	Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics.
8210	Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.
8211	Completely agree
8212	Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool
8213	Checking into it
8214	TeslaGong    TeslaStraya     Teslaownersau      If it passes Australian regulations, then sure
8215	Suppliers. We're only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasn't clear that we've actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard.
8216	New version coming soon
8217	Tesla What about a heavy duty, paintball machine gun mounted on the bed rails?
8218	We aren't cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3.
8219	Both will do original cars
8220	Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials.
8221	Total market
8222	Teslavibes That's total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution.
8223	SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all.
8224	SpaceX Fate loooves irony haha
8225	SpaceX We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does *not* like erratic cash flow haha. I'm a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.
8226	Tesla Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety

8232	Light is not as fast as you'd think
8233	Haha true. Why do showers have such a wide range!?
8234	Weld esthetics will improve greatly in upcoming Starships
8235	It's cool &amp; for sure can &amp; should be done, but I suspect its best case will be more costly than wind &amp; solar (aka big fusion reactor in sky)
8236	That's very hard to do. Have you tried pushing on the charge port door to open? It's designed to support a manual press to open as well as automatic.
8237	SpaceX     Great render! The circumferential welds &amp; skin panels will be much smoother in future builds.
8238	Yes, coming soon
8239	The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
8240	SpaceX  Good to see. Inspiring for future of space!
8241	Tesla Glad to hear your Mom is ok
8242	It's next-level
8243	The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.
8244	Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we're actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.
8245	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged
8246	Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn't required for Mars, so 4 is possible
8247	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Yes, Starlink is designed to enable competitive gaming
8248	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Very soon for higher latitudes like Seattle
8249	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Average latency will improve as more satellites launch (directly above you more frequently) &amp; more ground stations are deployed. As we're able to put more ground stations on roofs of server centers, legacy Internet latency will be zero.
8250	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Brownsville is quite far south, so probably 3 months or so for good connectivity -- needs several more Starlink launches. I'm using it at the little house I rent in the area. Definitely not good there yet.
8251	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Great
8252	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  High frequency lasers are the way to go for sure
8253	SpaceX SpaceXStarlink  Oh yeah, Starship update coming in about 3 weeks. The design has coalesced. What is presented will actually be what flies to orbit as V1.0 with almost no changes.
8254	TeslaClubIN   Next year for sure
8255	TeslaClubIN   Thanks for waiting!
8256	Tesla Haha
8257	Tesla  Teslarati Glad you're ok!
8258	I agree with Lex
8259	SpaceX We will need to make a lot of improvements to have a chance of completing 48 launches next year!
8260	SpaceX Exactly
8261	SpaceX All of that and more. We're doing a broad review of launch site, propulsion, structures, avionics, range &amp; regulatory constraints this weekend. I will also be at the Cape next week to review hardware in person.

8269	TeslaownersSV      Pretty wild, considering that Exxon was the most valuable company in the word when we went public 10 years ago
8270	This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term
8271	Hollywood should just start with the sequel &amp; skip the original, because financials
8272	The remake has the potential to be great. I kinda liked the original tbh, but it's possible to take it up a level.
8273	Rewatched Young Frankenstein this weekend. Still awesome. Ovaltine? 
8274	One of my favorite writers. Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential.
8275	Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11, because it's louder than 10  
8276	TeslaownersSV FSD will solve these issues
8277	Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla   
8278	It's a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.
8279	So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car's exhaust pipe.
8280	5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far. 
8281	4th flight &amp; landing for this booster 
8282	Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.
8283	Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that's needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
8284	We're not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
8285	RT SpaceX: Deployment of 60 Starlink satellites confirmed 
8286	SpaceX Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US &amp; hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.
8287	RT SpaceX: Falcon 9 launches 60 Starlink satellites to orbit, completing SpaceX's 43rd flight of a previously flown rocket booster 
8288	SpaceX It will soon
8289	SpaceX   Great photo!
8290	SpaceX Much sooner
8291	One of the best shots ever!
8292	Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking
8293	7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. We'll hopefully fix the leak today &amp; retest.
8294	I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart
8295	They are
8296	Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.
8297	We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage
8298	Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can't emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.
8299	Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
8300	Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it's fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.
8301	The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.
8302	Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
8303	But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
8304	Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.
8305	TeslaownersSV   Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product
8306	TeslaownersSV   That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.
8307	Sandy Munro understands engineering
8308	Tesladri    The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair
8309	That looks tasty!
8310	High bay should be finished (except for the giant gantry crane) within a few weeks. Super Heavy stacking should begin around then.
8311	SpaceX  You're most welcome!
8312	doner kebab
8313	Had the most amazing kebab ever just outside of Tacheles. Too bad that place got torn down. It was awesome.
8314	Mass ratio. Liquid oxygen is much denser than liquid methane, even when the latter is cooled to just above its freezing point.
8315	I definitely need to try these tasty cakes &amp; pastries on my next visit!
8316	TeslaTested We just completed a financing round, but will let you know when there is another one
8317	We do have giant steel balls haha

8322	SpaceX    Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand &amp; ship to booster.
8323	Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%
8324	Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks.
8325	Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler
8326	Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz 
8327	Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close -- a tantalizing local maximum -- but reality is just too messy &amp; weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once.
8328	It should be
8329	Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won't need to wait for FSD.
8330	RT SpaceX: Starman, last seen leaving Earth, made its first close approach with Mars today--within 0.05 astronomical units, or under 5 million miles, of the Red Planet 
8331	Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note
8332	Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   It's already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive.
8333	SpaceX Maybe this should be the flag of Mars
8334	Great pics!
8335	Yeah, it's not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesn't work well for complex enclosed volumes &amp; high strength or high temp alloys.
8336	SpaceX 
8337	Passed cryo proof
8338	Norway leads the world
8339	RT  We put the 2020 Tesla Model Y Long Range electric SUV on our test track to find out what it can do--and it turns out, well, quite a lot.
8340	SpaceX I'm proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha
8341	Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user.
8342	SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.
8343	SpaceX It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.
8344	SpaceX Our tiles are mechanically attached
8345	Teslarati Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
8346	SpaceX There are sensitive elements, but they're on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I've posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I've posted doesn't need to reverse engineer!
8347	Sweden was right 
8348	Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people &amp; quarantine vulnerable was right though imo.

8353	Interesting
8354	When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all.
8355	There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard's problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze'ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.
8356	Exactly. He plays the \poor inventor\ card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
8357	Definitely
8358	We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It's not a question of money. If there was a \great engineer\ factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.
8359	I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don't count!
8360	Even if half that amount, it's still a big deal!
8361	Yeah, there are literally &gt;1000% more cameras than 10 years ago, but still zero clear photos
8362	Teslarati I don't think this is accurate
8363	Uh ok, here we go ...
8364	Tesla  TeslaownersSV Teslarati  Glad Jen is safe!
8365	Accurate analysis. Quite a few  ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements.
8366	Tesla FSD computer's dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes -- they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.
8367	The SoC's sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it's fairly obvious when one is discordant
8368	Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.
8369	TeslaClubIN  Will release order configurator probably in Jan
8370	Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.
8371	This graph appears to be upside down
8372	Thank you, much more accurate haha
8373	Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn't clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it's right.
8374	Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It's just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.
8375	Diess is doing his best to move in the right direction, but he's in a tough position with so many constituencies to please. No way to make everyone happy.
8376	At least success is in the set of all possible outcomes this time!

8423	Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
8424	Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
8425	FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should.
8426	Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.   R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps.
8427	Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn't achieve anything, but I'm confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights.
8428	Got a little melty tbh :)

8433	Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt).

Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9's reliability (way beyond human).
8438	Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday
8439	SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case.
8440	Agreed. Are these performance tires?
8441	Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?
8442	There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
8443	Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
8444	Starship is coming together!
8445	Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
8446	Yup. With beta updates, there'll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast.
8447	Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
8448	Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website.
8449	I'm in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see.
8450	TeslaownersSV Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.

8459	Well, tbh, our capex efficiency in 2017 was trash 
8460	Tesla team has done great work!
8461	Bettern nothin or ur  back!
8462	And there were actually zero employees in the factory after GM/Toyota left. They took all good equipment &amp; sold most of rest for scrap. It looked apocalyptic inside.
8463	All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life.
8464	To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades.   Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.  GM &amp; Toyota took everything that worked &amp; moved it to their other factories.
8465	FEAR 2 is best imo. Also Dead Space 2. They will haunt your dreams.

8490	True. Also, fewer heart attacks, as way easier to pump blood in 37% gravity.

8492	TeslaownersSV  I've spent more than half my life in California &amp; love the state. But, frankly, I think CA has the winning-for-too-long problem.   Like a sports team with many championships, it is increasingly difficult to avoid complacency &amp; a sense of entitlement.
8493	TeslaownersSV  Yes
8494	TeslaownersSV This build should be noticeably better with interventions
8495	Latency will improve significantly soon. Bandwidth too.
8496	Teslatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!   Doing \neural nets\ without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they're doing. Reality is the hardest sim.
8497	TeslaownersSV Teslatino We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.
8498	TeslaownersSV Teslatino Faults will never be zero, but at some point the probability of a fault will be far lower than that of the average human
8499	TeslaownersSV  Teslatino Every 5 to 10 days
8500	Stable, controlled descent with body flaps would be great. Transferring propellant feed from main to header tanks &amp; relight would be a major win.
8501	But, a RUD right off launch pad is also possible. Fortunately, SN9 is almost ready.
8502	Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win
8503	Minor
8504	Yeah. Although, if it fails right at the end, some landing pad repair will be needed to fill in the crater.
8505	Lord of the ...
8506	We've tested a sub-scale version in a wind tunnel with active aero closing the loop for stability, so it will probably work at scale, but reality tends to bite you on the ass
8507	This is what matters most

8512	Sure, maybe in a month or so
8513	I could not be more excited about the new supercollider! That said, while it is considerably larger, I don't think it necessarily requires all that much incremental engineering.
8514	Very close to actual expected flight! 
8515	New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter.
8516	Several thousand more Starlink beta participation invitations going out this week
8517	Lower latitude states need more satellites in position, so probably January
8518	As soon as we get country approval. This is required for each country individually, as no EU-wide approval system exists. Probably start receiving final (there are many steps) approvals around Feb/March.
8519	Didn't realize that was possible. No problem if there's a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
8520	Canada and Norway are next after we get US out of early beta!
8521	Right now, it takes about 5 mins to set up, but, with future improvements, probably less than 3 mins. No technical knowledge needed. Just point at open sky &amp; plug in!
8522	As soon as we get regulatory approval. Hopefully, around middle of next year.
8523	Lowering Starlink terminal cost, which may sound rather pedestrian, is actually our most difficult technical challenge
8524	That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008. Last hour of last day possible, as investors were leaving town that night &amp; we were 3 days away from bankruptcy. I put in all money I had, didn't own a house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. Difficult time.
8525	I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt.
8526	Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time -- from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell.
8527	Super appreciate your support, Steve! That convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway. Fortunately, Daimler invested $50M in May 2009, 5 months later.
8528	Yes, although I didn't expect the stock to rise so much so soon. The reason for the stock options is that they're needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years.
8529	Yeah, that will be relatively easy, as so few users out in the ocean

8553	Neuralink won't overclock the brain, it will transfer processing to the supercomputer extension of your brain. This is basically what you do when you use a smartphone or computer, but a Neuralink will have orders of magnitude faster input &amp; output, especially latter.

8585	Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem.
8586	Burst disk worked, so vehicle appears to be ok. We'll have to swap out at least one of the engines.
8587	Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD.
8588	If it's happening to me, it's happening to others. I'm getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours.
8589	Symptoms of a typical cold. Nothing unusual so far.
8590	Exactly
8591	The carousel turns ever faster
8592	Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so \Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid\ is an equally correct title. The \rapid antigen test\ from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.
8593	Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.
8594	A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.   False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic: 
8595	What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?
8596	Interesting
8597	Interesting
8598	Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What's the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?
8599	Sure is
8600	From  
8601	Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.
8602	Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.
8603	Strange
8604	Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.
8605	Note, this is not the spike protein. They don't consider that reliable.
8606	Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not
8607	Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.
8608	Soon 
8609	Case closed 
8610	This a great reference! Worth a read.
8611	The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you're probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?
8612	Heneghan makes a lot of sense. Hilarious that he has to clarify that he runs the Center for *Evidence-Based* Medicine at Oxford . General public doesn't realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.

8614	Cold symptoms are gone for now 
8615	This seems accurate

8617	What's honey?
8618	Interesting. My Thursday night saliva sample came back today with N1 gene (unique to cov2) showing at cycle 26 &amp; N3 (generic sars) at 24. I get results of today's test tomorrow. Almost no symptoms today, so hopefully better results.

8625	Just a scratch. We can buff it out.
8626	Teslaownerssv Cool, but please be super cautious. Expect two steps forward, one back. Lot of new code was merged.
8627	In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I'm asking the wrong question, what is a better question?
8628	A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.
8629	They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it's high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes \positive\.
8630	Worth reading this thread if you're curious about rona testing 
8631	RT   Great question! It's more complex question and depends on why the test is being used - ie: do you want to know if you are currently contagious/risky to others or if you have any remnants of RNA? The difference may sound trivial but it is massive  1/

8640	Doing tests from several different labs, same time of day, administered by RN &amp; am requesting N1 gene PCR cycle threshold. There is no official standard for PCR testing. Not sure people realize this.
8641	Yeah, I feel pretty normal. No symptoms right now. Last week, I had symptoms of a minor cold. I've had some brutal flu/cold experiences, but this was mild &amp; hopefully over.

8648	RT  What song would you play on your ride out to the launch pad? #LaunchAmerica 
8649	Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety 
8650	Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety 
8651	The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering, as one use obviates the other
8652	Yeah, with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
8653	Launch in 5 minutes
8654	I'm ok, thanks for asking. No symptoms for past few days, apart from fatigue. Unless something changes, would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold.
8655	Great thread
8656	Creating synthetic mRNA for cures/vaccines is the future of medicine imo. Turns it (mostly) into a software &amp; modeling problem.
8657	CureVac, Moderna &amp; a few others. Tesla makes the machine CureVac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mRNA strands.

8660	RT SpaceX: Docking confirmed - Crew Dragon has arrived at the 
8661	Damn, that's not easy! I spent quite a bit of time looking at Russian/Ukrainian engines. They're good.
8662	Teslaownerssv   Wow, that's back when we were going to do a Falcon with 5 engines! We had no one who was willing to buy that, but we did have interest if we could do 9 engines. Sounded crazy at the time.
8663	Well said.
8664	Fate  Irony
8665	Special permission received from Stonecutters Guild! 
8666	They're on their way! Hopefully, more Teslaquila next month.
8667	Maybe *I* just love irony haha
8668	Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn't work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.
8669	Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it's less than 1% of the pain.
8670	We should just count the atoms at this point
8671	The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don't blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.
8672	About 2 secs after starting engines, martyte covering concrete below shattered, sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay. One rock blade severed avionics cable, causing bad shutdown of Raptor.
8673	Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields &amp; adding water-cooled steel pipes to test pad
8674	Pretty close. Definitely feel  if I take DayQuil. Frankly, this was one of the mildest cold/flu experiences I've ever had.
8675	Maybe making some notable changes. Will wait until figurative &amp; literal dust settles.
8676	Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn't matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.
8677	Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!
8678	Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.   What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.
8679	Exactly
8680	Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it's mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
8681	Dojo/Doge
8682	Indeed
8683	Nullius in Verba 
8684	More like he gave it his blessing. It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London.
8685	It's designed to make life multiplanetary, otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity!   Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined, including Falcon. Necessary, for a city on Mars.

8692	So many things you want &amp; some you didn't know you wanted
8693	And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether they're just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious.
8694	Deveras!
8695	I was going to say \Sim!\, but that seemed too obvious haha
8696	Life in glass domes at first. Eventually, terraformed to support life, like Earth.
8697	Teslaownerssv   No, just a mild cold. Same with my bro. Def had cov2 though. Pc&lt;20 means viral load of &gt;10 million per mL.
8698	Wise words from Bogle. The point of companies is products &amp; services. They have no point in &amp; of themselves, nor do these indices. Buy &amp; hold stock in companies where you love the product roadmap, sell where you don't. 
8699	The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla
8700	That is certainly the intention!
8701	Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization - discovering our ruins - will be impressed humans got that far.
8702	Tesla A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units!

8706	SpaceX 13 years &amp; $11 billion ... wow
8707	Teslaownerssv Next week's release is special. Lot of fundamental improvements, both important bug fixes &amp; entire new areas of functionality.
8708	Teslaownerssv Unfortunately, there are too many rules around liquor distribution, even in the US. However, we will be selling the lightning bottle &amp; shot glasses worldwide.
8709	Teslaownerssv If next week's release looks good, we will widen beta
8710	Haha sexy cropping champion of all time
8711	Caution strongly advised with SPACs
8712	Change out a few parts, otherwise fine
8713	Congrats!
8714	Wild times!
8715	They have an old version of our software &amp; don't have our NN inference computer
8716	Yeah. They stole Apple's code too. 
8717	Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej.
8718	To be clear, this was just an XPeng problem. Other companies in China have not done this.
8719	SpaceX I can't comment on turbopump internal details, but you're roughly in the ballpark. Wow, rocket turbopumps, especially if oxygen-rich, are insanely hard! Arguably, the hardest mechanical/fluids/combustion problem known to exist.
8720	Well done!
8721	SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship
8722	This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with    Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you're going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm.
8723	Exactly
8724	Reality looks like a strange ghost-world at radar wavelengths. Almost everything except metal is translucent.

8732	Well, almost anything 
8733	Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise it'd be wrong to ask others to do so.
8734	SpaceX     Where it should be!
8735	SpaceX     Actually, off to the side (so it doesn't take out the launch mount in bad landing), but with the same arm used to pick up the ship
8736	Landing at Vandenberg AFB in California 
8737	Largest cast titanium part in the world. No heat shielding needed.
8738	Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products
8739	Our data center was named Skynet as a joke over 10 years ago. Might have been tempting fate!

8741	Fate loves irony, but hates hypocrisy
8742	We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point.
8743	Teslaownerssv  Sure
8744	Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket, landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You
8745	Tesla Wow
8746	Exciting mission!
8747	Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant.
8748	Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip We're still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference.
8749	Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip Yes
8750	Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
8751	Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it's probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.
8752	Not yet
8753	Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.
8754	Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.
8755	Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance
8756	But that's why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10
8757	Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.
8758	Major upgrades are slated for SN15
8759	This is a subject of much debate
8760	Teslatino   Yes, but only slightly filled
8761	This is a life leader launch, so more risk than normal 
8762	The Promise is greatly needed
8763	Haha true
8764	TeslaChillMode    Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically.
8765	Teslaownerssv  TeslaChillMode    Hopefully next month
8766	Happy Thanksgiving!
8767	But actually! 
8768	Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great
8769	fp16 with least important digits truncated (so it feels like fp32) is what we're betting on for training with Dojo
8770	Probably going to a wider beta in ~2 weeks
8771	Yeah, truncate zeros &amp; then round
8772	For a second there, I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha
8773	Yes, very sad news. Tony was great.
8774	SpaceX It will have landing legs
8775	Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday.
8776	Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights
8777	Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.
8778	It will be real soon
8779	Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX! Some of the best memories ever.

8834	Ascent to the Heavens 
8835	RT SpaceX: Starship landing flip maneuver 
8836	The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue: 
8837	Original Deus Ex was incredible, Human Revolution was also great
8838	Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world's most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict.
8839	Sure hope that future doesn't come to pass!
8840	Dankeschon Brandenburg und Grunheide!
8841	Perhaps slightly more confident, but it's essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.
8842	It's a good to great game imo, but improving what may seem like mere surface detail would make it unequivocally great
8843	Far from fully loaded, but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high/far with three engines
8844	The Raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altitude limit. As we hit min throttle point, an engine would shut off.
8845	I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare
8846	Oh and umm ... 
8847	A t-shirt being better armor than a Kevlar chest plate doesn't make sense in the absence of magic. Also, wish there weren't level-based item limits in a single-player game.

8880	Tesla   Hi Liz!
8881	Sparta's reply to Macedon
8882	Strange, if true.   - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.  - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?
8883	During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.
8884	Good idea
8885	Frictionless AI. What could possibly go wrong?

8915	Interesting
8916	Good point
8917	No, but definitely this year
8918	TeslaownersSV  You mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don't have it?
8919	TeslaownersSV  Ok, service might be able to do this. Will check.
8920	Very important
8921	Tesla Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique -- not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus.
8922	Focus on making products &amp; services people truly love, so that the total economic pie is bigger, instead of engaging in zero-sum/negative-sum corporate power struggles. This is the good future.
8923	Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon.
8924	Taste of the future

8926	What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
8927	Absolutely
8928	Just meeting with Larry Ellison to seek some advice. Back working on Tesla end of quarter tomorrow.
8929	Entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves
8930	Starlink \poses a hazard\ to Viasat's profits, more like it. Stop the sneaky moves, Charlie Ergen!
8931	Tesla No, these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase. FSD build is a fundamental rewrite, not just in the car, but also our video training/labeling software.
8932	We need a UI overhaul
8933	This is not CGI 
8934	Such a weird game when you think about it

8944	All Tesla cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the Full Self-Driving option for free. Delivery &amp; docs must be fully complete by midnight Dec 31st.
8945	Destiny, destiny No escaping  that for me
8946	Are we sure this is real?
8947	Literally
8948	This is very sensible. Opposition from anywhere cannot mean no progress everywhere!
8949	Seems odd that the opposition group is from BMW's home state of Baveria. That's very far from Brandenburg, where Tesla is building the Gigafactory.   And why would a group that claims to be pro-environment oppose a sustainable energy factory? Aren't there more important issues?
8950	Snake-head dog had my undivided attention until winder-head ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant 
8951	We're going to try to catch the Super Heavy Booster with the launch tower arm, using the grid fins to take the load

8966	Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can't speak for regulators though.
8967	Um, we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance
8968	RT Tesla: In 2020, we produced and delivered half a million cars. Huge thanks to all those who made this possible. 
8969	So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. 
8970	Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it.

8988	Teslarati  This will be hard to make, as it isn't like any other vehicle
8989	Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but that's more of a long-term solution.
8990	Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O --&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.
8991	Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)

8994	Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.
8995	His sick beats 
8996	Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.

9104	Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD
9105	The entire \stack\ from data collection through labeling &amp; inference has to be in surround video. This is a hard problem. Critically, however, this does not require a hardware change to cars in field.

9159	T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

9162	SpaceX   He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.

9191	SpaceX Yes
9192	SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky
9193	SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.

9311	SpaceXFan97 Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then it's about densifying coverage.   Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas.   Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas.
9312	TeslaownersSV Final design is looking Was just in the studio
9313	The Tesla Solar Roof is slightly hydrophobic, so water, snow or ice slide off easily

9325	One of them may be in limited operation by end of year
9326	Interesting
9327	TeslaownersSV  We're upgrading all NNs to surround video, using subnets on focal areas (vs equal compute on all uncropped pixels) &amp; many other things, so more time needed to write &amp; validate software. Maybe something next week.  This is evolving into solving a big part of physical world AI.
9328	TeslaownersSV  Seems likely
9329	They will fly there from our launch site.   Stationed around the world.

9345	Tesla Prices in the US (of all goods) don't include VAT, but it's usually included in other countries.   Then there's import duty &amp; transport costs.  The intent is that revenue to Tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs &amp; transport make up the difference.
9346	I hope they do! It would be awesome 
9347	This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells.

9393	Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000's of car startups. Prototypes are easy, production is hard &amp; being cash flow positive is excruciating.

9399	Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. We've never seen this before.  Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues.
9400	Starhopper is an old timer who has seen a lot of things!
9401	If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but it's getting mature.
9402	This was way past leg loads. They got squashed hard.
9403	Beta V8.3 has literally ~1000 improvements. Will take time to QA internally before release probably in two or three weeks.
9404	Doge spelled backwards is Egod
9405	Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding \Download Beta\ button to Service section of car display in ~10 days 
9406	Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing.   Note: word \Beta\ is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.
9407	The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option.
9408	Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems.
9409	The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise).
9410	Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built.
9411	Great band, too bad they broke up

9413	Carnot efficiency of the Universe?

9416	It's all hot air in the end haha
9417	Starbase, Texas 
9418	Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp; RVs.
9419	... it until you make it
9420	Delamain AI cabs should be able to drive themselves when you're in them &amp; be electric by 2077
9421	Assuming user approves warning &amp; agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest QA-tested FSD \Beta\ build as soon as car connects to wifi
9422	Build 8.3 of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so that's roughly when download button should show up
9423	We will ask the regulators
9424	SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.
9425	Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
9426	There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.
9427	Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
9428	Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster
9429	Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it's not a gamechanger.
9430	I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
9431	Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
9432	Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has \spare\ performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
9433	RT SpaceX: Liftoff! 
9434	If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.  A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.   Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
9435	Like  but *with* self-driving haha

9493	SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary -- full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth.  Starlink's purpose is to provide Internet to the least served &amp; to pay for Mars.
9494	The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.
9495	They are aiming too low.   Only rockets that are fully &amp; rapidly reusable will be competitive.   Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets.

9618	When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.
9619	Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar).   Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it.   As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.
9620	Tesla_adri  These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.

9632	Tesla Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their \approved\ collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.
9633	Tesla Absolutely
9634	SpaceX Tesla True. Ancient times ... Had to flip CPU registers explicitly, as computer was so slow.
9635	SpaceX Tesla That was my night job. Day job was working on ruthenium-tantalum ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research.
9636	SpaceX Tesla Yeah, not scalable. My grad student idea was to try to use advanced chip making equipment to create high energy density capacitors accurate to molecular level.
9637	Getting there
9638	Maybe it's about how you use it

9640	Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI.
9641	Probably late July
9642	Will investigate
9643	Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.  This is a \march of 9's\ trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving.
9644	Same timing
9645	Hopefully addressed this summer
9646	Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing.

9654	While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.  Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it's hopeless. This is insanely hard.

9674	Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle 
9675	Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half.   Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again.   Doesn't mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.
9676	Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas

9691	Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.  Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.
9692	Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery
9693	Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.
9694	Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised.   Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month.   Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.
9695	Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.  In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.
9696	Very important. Most people don't know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.
9697	Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
9698	If Tesla owners are \conspiracy theorists\, then it would be fair to call them \advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers\.   If that's an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths ...
9699	Does seem a little weird
9700	I'm staying at a friend's place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall.   When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don't even flicker. Owner says he doesn't notice.

9721	We just got approval to open a new Supercharger station in Malibu!
9722	True. The opposite in fact - I provide financial support to my parents.
9723	An advantage I did have is that my father is a talented electrical &amp; mechanical engineer, so I was taught a lot engineering (without appreciating it at the time)
9724	Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels.   What's really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks!
9725	No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.
9726	Seems quite likely at least based on revenue in 2022 &amp; possibly total units in 2023
9727	Can't get it up (to orbit) lol
9728	True 
9729	Starship SN15 static fire completed, preparing for flight later this week
9730	I find it more helpful to read/follow individual journalists, rather than publications.   Any given publication is going to have wide range of views, albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative, perhaps reflecting innate human biases.  Citizen journalism FTW!
9731	Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product.   I trust the people.
9732	FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time, I agree with regulators!   On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn't anticipate.
9733	They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo.   Strange that they aren't taking more action on some of the SPACs.

9869	I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.  This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not.
9870	TeslaGong  Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
9871	TeslaGong  Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition - same as a hardcore roller coaster.
9872	TeslaGong  Ideally 0.1kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate
9873	TeslaGong  Achieving truly decentralized finance - power to the people - is a noble &amp; important goal.
