<BOS> Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month.  This is a \march of 9's\ trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving. <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Your Cybertruck is here. It's just ... a toy. The Hot Wheels Tesla Cybertruck goes 25 miles per hour and accelerates like a demon. The headlights and taillights work and it even comes with two stickers that \shatter\ the side windows.  Details: <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly! Well said. <EOS>
<BOS> Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it's less than 1% of the pain. <EOS>
<BOS> To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want. <EOS>
<BOS> Online <EOS>
<BOS> Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better <EOS>
<BOS> Just reviewed Tesla's service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months. <EOS>
<BOS> Catapults are a great way to get somewhere fast <EOS>
<BOS> Great. Also love Princess Mononoke. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy. <EOS>
<BOS> Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it's all land. Even when warmed up &amp; water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land. <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: We were very honored to accept one of Europe's most prestigious awards yesterday, Das Goldene Lenkrad (the Golden Steering Wheel), with Model 3 scoring the highest of all tested cars <EOS>
<BOS> Tesladri    The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair <EOS>
<BOS> I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> They are correct. It's awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight. <EOS>
<BOS> More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP) <EOS>
<BOS> It's actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people &amp; good for environment. I think that's fundamental goodness. <EOS>
<BOS> This thread summarizes situation perfectly <EOS>
<BOS> Meant to say skuchnyi idiot <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla \Virtue signaling\ is super annoying &amp; there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But I'm really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero. <EOS>
<BOS> In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem. <EOS>

<BOS> Trying have fewer parts, so strakes are unlikely. Some very counterintuitive CFD results in both hypersonic &amp; subsonic regimes. Starship does controlled falling more than flying. <EOS>
<BOS> Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn't consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force! <EOS>

<BOS> Should be in next update <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed. <EOS>

<BOS> 3 guys standing on roof of skyscraper. 1st guy says updraft is so strong it blows you back on roof of you jump off. He jumps off &amp; is blown back on roof. 2nd guy tries &amp; goes splat. 3rd guy: that was a dirty trick Superman. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Powerwall doesn't need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels <EOS>
<BOS> 4 Astronauts fly to  on Sat night from Cape. First operational flight of Crew Dragon. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla You're welcome! <EOS>
<BOS> No, but definitely this year <EOS>
<BOS> This can be done. Probably should be. <EOS>
<BOS> Winter is coming <EOS>
<BOS> Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out <EOS>
<BOS> Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful. <EOS>
<BOS> Gasoline or diesel? <EOS>
<BOS> It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation <EOS>
<BOS> Stop by The Petersen is you'd like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck. <EOS>
<BOS> Model 3 Performance <EOS>
<BOS> Would be great to combine blood donations with a C19 antibody test, so you know if you're immune. Refill blood banks &amp; give donors peace of mind. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaM3Spain Tesla OTA <EOS>
<BOS> Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional &amp; city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe &amp; Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR &amp; Hearst were all major investors in Zip2. <EOS>
<BOS> Launch in 5 minutes <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaCharts Then you'll be fine <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Schatz, bitte hor auf- ich werde rot! <EOS>
<BOS> This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude. <EOS>
<BOS> Govt has been unwelcome <EOS>
<BOS> It's USB-C <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3. <EOS>
<BOS> Explains the sad lack of progress in candy research! <EOS>
<BOS> Whether Z-pak works in this situation or not, it's a kickass med for many maladies <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla We'd be happy to help <EOS>
<BOS> He might run for President in 2024 <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> More details on day of launch, currently tracking to Wednesday <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Here's a Tesla spec ad I cut for fun.  TeslaMotorsClub SpaceX #tesla #specad #elonmusk #spacex <EOS>
<BOS> Fine, but that was an easy one <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla FSD computer's dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes -- they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails. <EOS>
<BOS> Presentation starting at 8:15 <EOS>
<BOS> About 2.5 hours to T-0 for Falcon Heavy. Watch sim for highlight reel of what we hope happens. Car actually takes 6 months to cover 200M+ miles to Mars <EOS>
<BOS> Crazy times! <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Testing Raptor in vertical configuration (on the giant tripod) should allow us to simplify some aspects of the engine design <EOS>
<BOS> Lil baby <EOS>
<BOS> Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere. <EOS>
<BOS> Good explanation. 4D is essential for dynamically occluded objects, especially in large intersections with dense vehicle &amp; pedestrian traffic. Frame rate &amp; latency from frame to wheel vector change also important. <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country. <EOS>
<BOS> The Persuader hammer will fix SN1 <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, just use a dryer outlet. High power, easy to install &amp; low cost. <EOS>
<BOS> They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it's high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes \positive\. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing is more absurd than reality! This silly [?][?] drawing that was just added as a silly example for our sketchpad Easter egg has bothered me more than anything today. I definitely care about artists getting compensated. It would be unfair not to do so. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati We're changing Powerwall Storm Watch to Disaster Watch. Covers more bases. <EOS>
<BOS> The high bay is measured to fit! <EOS>
<BOS> Haha true. Yet, still, so much dignity is ascribed to horses! <EOS>
<BOS> One person's MRI machine is another's railgun! Made a primitive one when I was studying physics at Penn. Hard to wield though. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV cgi irl <EOS>
<BOS> Zero Suit <EOS>
<BOS> Docs make good points <EOS>
<BOS> It may have started already <EOS>
<BOS> What do you think we're living in? <EOS>
<BOS> RT Teslarati: First look at a Tesla Model 3 driving to its owner on Enhanced Summon <EOS>
<BOS> I first read this as making wind with <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Haha <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Lasers <EOS>
<BOS> Medical check is A-ok! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, dramatically improved imo <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX I still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration cooking. In theory, it would use more mass than a tile heatshield, but that remains to be seen. <EOS>
<BOS> Was good maybe 5 or 6 years ago when you could wonder around &amp; find great unknown bands <EOS>
<BOS> In a million years, the Universe will go from being 13.772 to 13.773 billion years old. Like tears in the rain ... <EOS>
<BOS> Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time? <EOS>
<BOS> It's counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant &amp; pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers &amp; stabilizing ship if landing in high winds! <EOS>
<BOS> Awesome!! <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, mechanical logic gates <EOS>
<BOS> Seems like they should make a whole outfit out of that material <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing! <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe this goat is available <EOS>
<BOS> Coming soon! <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati As far as we know, it's the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn't need heat shielding or even paint. <EOS>
<BOS> Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaratiTeam Teslarati No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA) <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla   Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla You're right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently. <EOS>
<BOS> Haha true <EOS>
<BOS> How'd they know!? <EOS>
<BOS> Side boosters, yes, but too much load through center core <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati I had no idea this existed. Sounds awesome though! <EOS>
<BOS> You're an idiot <EOS>
<BOS> Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner <EOS>
<BOS> Long lasting battery + fast recharge &gt; pack swap <EOS>
<BOS> Milady, my shield is yours <EOS>
<BOS> 107 expansion ratio. You can a little bit of flow separation towards the end of the nozzle. <EOS>
<BOS> In his 18th Brumaire essay (in which he does make some good points), Marx famously said history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. This is now ironically happening with Marxism. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That's why. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla One day's grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, v close! Nice work. Those are V0.9 legs, so major upgrades coming. Need wider span, longer stroke &amp; ability to auto-level for uneven ground or leaning into high winds. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_addicted Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon <EOS>
<BOS> I wish <EOS>
<BOS> Great differences in technology exist in the world about which even hardcore technologists are unaware <EOS>
<BOS> Cookie decorating contest with kids <EOS>
<BOS> The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party! <EOS>
<BOS> What's technology? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe Cybertruck will have it ... <EOS>
<BOS> AI makes more progress <EOS>
<BOS> Candy is coming <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla        Cool <EOS>
<BOS> Marina Del Rey location also open <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> Ben &amp; Jerry's cookie dough is also next-level. Can't have that in the house. It's too good! <EOS>
<BOS> Just deleted my Twitter account <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Tesla Model 3 Breaks EV Distance Record - 2781 km (1728 miles) Travelled in 24 hours <EOS>
<BOS> The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV  Hopefully fully operational in 2020 <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks George! <EOS>
<BOS> RT  .SpaceX and the  are targeting no earlier than June 24 at 11:30 p.m. EDT to launch the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center's STP-2 mission.   Learn more about the  launching on the Falcon Heavy later this month: <EOS>
<BOS> This makes no sense for many other reasons too. They don't actually have spectrum priority, they have shared spectrum &amp; nothing about this company is UK, except post office box. Money would be better spent on actual UK satellite industry! <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! <EOS>
<BOS> Also, cars are called \automobiles\ <EOS>
<BOS> Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch <EOS>
<BOS> Pronouns suck <EOS>
<BOS> None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together &amp; messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts <EOS>
