<BOS> Wise words from Gary the Bot <EOS>
<BOS> Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We're simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed. <EOS>

<BOS> Teslatunity  There aren't really meant to be \Tesla incentives\, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all. <EOS>
<BOS> We're adding a \party &amp; camper mode\ soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music &amp; power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock ... <EOS>
<BOS> Pretty much <EOS>

<BOS> We're doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we're just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead. <EOS>
<BOS> Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80's as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV  No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That's the sales pitch. Want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can't compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don't want Tesla to die too. <EOS>

<BOS> Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to 25GunsTesla.com. <EOS>
<BOS> Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. <EOS>
<BOS> Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I've ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone. <EOS>
<BOS> That's the basic idea <EOS>
<BOS> Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor -- far more than in design of the engine itself! <EOS>

<BOS> Tesla Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. <EOS>

<BOS> Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I'm confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions. <EOS>

<BOS> This is great advice <EOS>
<BOS> Hoping to include last three in this release, with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel (while stationary tbc haha) <EOS>
<BOS> It would be great if labs could give people this level of granular feedback in their results <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla No, we're focused on developing new products &amp; scaling production <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  Haha true <EOS>
<BOS> Tinny <EOS>
<BOS> Does seem a bit high <EOS>
<BOS> Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaTrip Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week. <EOS>
<BOS> They will fly there from our launch site.   Stationed around the world. <EOS>
<BOS> Yup. With beta updates, there'll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Autopilot Team <EOS>
<BOS> Just sent some <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Wow <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Starlink will connect the globe with reliable and affordable high-speed broadband services <EOS>
<BOS> Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry <EOS>
<BOS> We will use a catapult &amp; air mattresses to land on the roof, then base jump off <EOS>
<BOS> Done. Now $2k via in-app purchase. <EOS>
<BOS> Weird that so many troll/bot accounts were activated to attack on this fake issue. Wonder who's behind it. <EOS>
<BOS> Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. <EOS>
<BOS> So true  John Clarke <EOS>
<BOS> RT  NEWS:  &amp; SpaceX are targeting no earlier than Oct. 23 for Crew Dragon's first operational mission to the  with   Shannon Walker and  pending certification following a successful Demo-2 test flight. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV <EOS>
<BOS> RT Teslarati: Tesla innovation leads to another big step forward on battery range, drivetrain design, and suspension. Model S, X get updated to 370 mi, 325 mi range on the same 100 kWh battery pack, plus new Fully Adaptive air suspension <EOS>
<BOS> Just a static fire tomorrow. Flight no earlier than Wednesday. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly. This is not fully appreciated. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we've been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.  Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_truth Definitely <EOS>
<BOS> Romance Mode <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Aiming for 20km flight in Oct &amp; orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept 28th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn't matter. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Not that I know of <EOS>
<BOS> Ok [?] <EOS>
<BOS> Always look on the bright side of life ... <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaGong    It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don't want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain &amp; motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you for the thoughtful letter <EOS>
<BOS> One of my favorite writers. Foundation is tough to make into a movie, but has outstanding potential. <EOS>
<BOS> Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway <EOS>
<BOS> Not if you had a wide elastic at the top <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point. <EOS>

<BOS> One day Starship will land on the rusty sands of Mars <EOS>
<BOS> Only a matter of time <EOS>
<BOS> Reviewed design with Franz last night. Even 3% smaller is too small. Will be pretty much this size. We'll probably do a smaller, tight world truck at some point. <EOS>
<BOS> But Taycan does seem like a good car. Nurburgring track time is great. <EOS>

<BOS> Oh behave u naughty planet ... <EOS>
<BOS> RT  I had a great time talking with  again yesterday. It was a fun 3 hours on AI, martial arts, and autonomous vehicles. Here's an excerpt from a longer discussion on  and Tesla Autopilot. Full conversation: <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: 3/ New apps: there is now a web browser, calendar and an energy app for Model 3 <EOS>
<BOS> The body panels will actually be laser cut! <EOS>
<BOS> Also, Critical Thinking <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing is both real &amp; imaginary <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati  This will be hard to make, as it isn't like any other vehicle <EOS>
<BOS> Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made <EOS>
<BOS> I'm in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Physics <EOS>
<BOS> &amp; <EOS>
<BOS> 10 hat aficionados, in appreciation for their exquisite taste in millinery, will be picked at random to tour the LA tunnel &amp; drive boring machine <EOS>

<BOS> TeslaownersSV Haha true <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Teslarati  Here in the UK too! <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Wow, wow, wow!  SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket launched the STP-2 mission at 2:30am this morning. The two side cores, flying their second mission, returned to land successfully at Cape Canaveral.   It was incredible. Simply incredible. <EOS>
<BOS> RT   Could be very close call. Earth is ~4.5B years old &amp; sun will expand to heat Earth beyond livable temp in ~0.5B years, so if advent of civilization took 10% longer, it wouldn't have happened at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Keyword \future\ <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Sure is. I live here. Air quality is especially bad near highways. <EOS>
<BOS> Uhh, it's literally made of rock <EOS>
<BOS> Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We'll build several ships just to improve the production system. <EOS>
<BOS> We're creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we'll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can't be made using standard methods. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla V10.0 just started rolling out to all US Tesla owners with FSD option &amp; \advanced download\ selected in vehicle software settings <EOS>

<BOS> Sigh. This is crux of matter: can't make system too annoying or people won't use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can't allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!? <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceXMR Soon it will be real <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator <EOS>

<BOS> Teslarati It's slightly better <EOS>
<BOS> Agreed <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. Also, thank you to  without whom this would not be possible. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with <EOS>
<BOS> Indeed it was <EOS>
<BOS> Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!  If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options: <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Successful deployment of 60 Starlink satellites confirmed! <EOS>
<BOS> It's almost done <EOS>
<BOS> I become Tiesto at night <EOS>
<BOS> Way too many paywalls &amp; spawn points <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not. <EOS>
<BOS> As you'd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy. <EOS>
<BOS> My fav character <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceXJobs: From all the women at SpaceX who are helping to engineer the future of space exploration, happy International Women's Day! <EOS>
<BOS> Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by \Teslaquilla\ bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.   This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point?  Happy New Month! <EOS>
<BOS> Great work by Tesla software engineering <EOS>

<BOS> Happy Home Planet Day! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_truth Yes <EOS>
<BOS> RT  One year ago today, I was picking up my Tesla at the international center. There were 1,000s of other Canadians doing the same. It was and continues to be an amazing purchase choice.   is 100% correct, a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car. <EOS>
<BOS> We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference -- about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX      To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don't lie. <EOS>

<BOS> Please send examples of prior work when applying. Looking for max playability &amp; creativity. <EOS>
<BOS> Take the red pill <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it's not a gamechanger. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_truth  Science <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: What did you tell your significant other to get them to let you buy a Tesla?   (Asking for a friend) <EOS>
<BOS> The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise). <EOS>

<BOS> SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX  human kind <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Dragon is on its way to the International Space Station. Capture by  crew set for Monday morning. <EOS>
<BOS> More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading). <EOS>
<BOS> One of the engines is suspect, so we're swapping it out <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, system should adapt to most likely destination &amp; anticipate school, then work, if that's owner preference <EOS>

<BOS> This is how we will view fossil fuel cars <EOS>
<BOS> If it's happening to me, it's happening to others. I'm getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours. <EOS>
<BOS> It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, being a phased array antenna, it is actually rather flat! <EOS>

<BOS> Foundation by Asimov <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes. <EOS>
<BOS> Definitely not right that the other officers were charged with nothing. What message does this send in general to officers who stand by while another does wrong? #JusticeForGeorge <EOS>

<BOS> No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what's hard. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla (Formerly) mainstream media has systemic negative &amp; political bias about almost everything. Reading major newspapers makes you feel sad &amp; angry. That's why they're being crushed by  Likes/retweets of old media are extremely low. Ironic article: <EOS>
<BOS> Sigh ... there should be a new supersonic jet, this time electric <EOS>
<BOS> High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren't hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, improvement is exponential <EOS>
<BOS> We def could be wrong about this, but it's actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don't need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower. <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Watch Falcon 9 launch 60 Starlink satellites - <EOS>

<BOS> It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail <EOS>

<BOS> I'm actually less crazy in person ... or am I? <EOS>
<BOS> No, but I will <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money. <EOS>
<BOS> Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not. <EOS>
<BOS> As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic. <EOS>

<BOS> The Tesla Solar Roof is slightly hydrophobic, so water, snow or ice slide off easily <EOS>
<BOS> That's the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points. <EOS>

<BOS> RT  Very exciting. Prior to 2019.16.2 my car could not take this exit on its own.   Further, With AP on the ramp, it would panic and tell me to take over as it couldn't pic a lane.   Today the car handled the whole situation! Well done Tesla and   #tesla #NavOnAP #Autopilot <EOS>
<BOS> Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC. <EOS>
<BOS> There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest. <EOS>

<BOS> My point exactly <EOS>
<BOS> That tweet did take immense effort  Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course I still love you <EOS>
<BOS> Reddit is massive, but def has gems <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: When the grid goes down, stored energy in Powerwall means you can:   * keep the lights on  * do your laundry * play videogames instead of taking this rare opportunity to connect with your loved ones. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati  Special mention of Tesla China <EOS>
<BOS> Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.   It's already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive. <EOS>
<BOS> Running track in SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaTested That's an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease. <EOS>

<BOS> Coming soon <EOS>
<BOS> Unis3x <EOS>
<BOS> Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ... <EOS>

<BOS> About 10 orbit synch windows, which are every 26 months, so self-sufficiency around 2050 <EOS>
<BOS> Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight. <EOS>
<BOS> I've never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven't forgotten UAW betrayed them. That's why UAW can't even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote. <EOS>
<BOS> Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros. <EOS>
<BOS> Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission. <EOS>
<BOS> We don't. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaBull  Never seen anything like it. Tesla is just trying to make electric cars &amp; solar power for a better future for all. True, we might not succeed, but why do they want us to fail? <EOS>

<BOS> This is how we make Falcon 9 <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes, but  in  that we're creating a generalized autonomy solution. Must work in millions of strange  situations. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue. <EOS>

<BOS> Tesla Noted <EOS>
<BOS> In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly &amp; direct flipping of CPU registers. That company's name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony. <EOS>

<BOS> Teslarati Truth is stranger than fiction <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX  Yes <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: \My Model S continues to be the best product of any kind that I have ever purchased\ <EOS>
<BOS> Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have 50's diner &amp; 100 best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now <EOS>
<BOS> Just some used Antminer L3+ rigs bought off eBay. Not really economic, but it was a fun family project. <EOS>
<BOS> Absolutely <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla True <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, will be extremely intense. Early flights are especially dangerous, as there's a lot of new hardware. <EOS>
<BOS> What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX  Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead! <EOS>
<BOS> Very close <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_truth  Yeah <EOS>
<BOS> It's all hot air in the end haha <EOS>
<BOS> RT  5/ One last point here: Ferguson gives the lockdown credit, which is *interesting* - the UK only began ita lockdown 2 days ago, and the theory is that lockdowns take 2 weeks or more to work. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX True <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla <EOS>
<BOS> Seven years for sure to 30M+ new fully electric vehicles per year, six years maybe. Five years is possible, but unlikely. An extra year makes a giant difference when it comes to exponentials. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Probably 18m for next gen system <EOS>
<BOS> We're now building flight design of Starship SN1, but each SN will have at least minor improvements, at least through SN20 or so of Starship V1.0. <EOS>
<BOS> kripto <EOS>
<BOS> More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven <EOS>
<BOS> That's pretty much what happened <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, they seemed optimistic too <EOS>
<BOS> Elon University is a real place <EOS>
<BOS> Also, system should autodelete old data automatically by default <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. Wings don't work on the moon at all and def not well on Mars. Also, no runways. <EOS>
<BOS> So awesome! <EOS>
<BOS> RT   Lake Show <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called \Low Gear\! <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceXFan97  So far, so good <EOS>
<BOS> It's only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, although Starlink works best for low population density situations <EOS>
<BOS> L'Ambroisie, Place des Vosges <EOS>
<BOS> Guess you been watching Cobra Kai <EOS>
<BOS> Well said, Brian Williams! <EOS>
<BOS> Only limitation is high density of users in urban areas. Most likely, all of the initial 500k will receive service. More of a challenge when we get into the several million user range. <EOS>
<BOS> Made on Earth by humans <EOS>
<BOS> More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin th/2, as I recall, but doesn't matter, as there's no geo  anywhere near that mass. <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: SpaceX training of astronauts that will fly on board Dragon's first operational mission is complete! When the crew arrives for pre-launch preparations at the launch site, they will participate in a run-through of day-of-launch activities with the launch and pad operations teams <EOS>
<BOS> Order online in 2 mins, 7 day return policy <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Aspirationally <EOS>
<BOS> To air is human <EOS>
<BOS> We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out. <EOS>
<BOS> And those who weren't expecting a ternary joke <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly. How cheaply freedom is sold. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Good idea <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't mind DA2. DA1 was awesome. Mass Effect 2 (talking about sequels) is amazing. <EOS>
<BOS> New design is better with many minor tweaks. Even the small details matter. <EOS>
<BOS> Engineers, artists &amp; creators of all kinds. There is so much to build. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he's above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again. <EOS>
<BOS> Wort reading the whole thing <EOS>
<BOS> Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. We've never seen this before.  Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure looks that way <EOS>
<BOS> Mad respect for the makers of things <EOS>
<BOS> 7 to 10 years <EOS>
<BOS> That would be a nice touch <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth. <EOS>
<BOS> Metal has a fudge-like consistency near its melting point, so you can just smoosh it together <EOS>
<BOS> This looks cool <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we just finished two more propellant domes. SpaceX team &amp; supporting suppliers are doing amazing work ramping Starship production. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Haha how is this even real? <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Tencent Auto Editor in chief Chang Yan is the first one in  to test drive China-made #Model3. As a model 3 owner himself (delivered back in March), he has a lot to say about the good qualities of his test vehicle. It handles well, smooth, quick, and noticeably quiet. He is impressed. <EOS>
<BOS> It's possible to make a self-sustaining city on Mars by 2050, if we start in 5 years &amp; take 10 orbital synchronizations <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they're already there <EOS>
<BOS> Teslatunity  Agreed <EOS>
<BOS> I still only own 0.25 Bitcoins btw <EOS>
<BOS> Current production is slightly better <EOS>
<BOS> This is why we put extra filters in all Tesla cars. S &amp; X even have hospital operating room grade HEPA filters. <EOS>
<BOS> Uh oh <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Hard to believe it's almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service <EOS>
<BOS> Great work by Tesla China team &amp; supporting contractors! <EOS>
<BOS> Raptor engine mounted on Starhopper. Aiming for hover test Tues. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn't fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_truth Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> Good point, small oil is a problem too <EOS>
<BOS> We didn't steal his mug crayon drawing of a farting unicorn, We didn't benefit from it, We don't want it, And we still offered to pay for it. You are a jackass. <EOS>
<BOS> Ahem, you have \nano\ in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs. <EOS>

<BOS> ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I'd be way more scared of a steak knife. <EOS>
<BOS> Sorry, many unexpected challenges with cars coming through Zeebrugge first time. Cars will start moving out in volume tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I try so hard to help them ... <EOS>
<BOS> Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco &amp; other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX's success. Great respect &amp; appreciation! <EOS>
<BOS> Sunset <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Completed a full duration test fire of the Raptor Vacuum engine at SpaceX's rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas <EOS>
<BOS> We are (obviously) also looking for world-class chip designers to join our team, based in both Palo Alto &amp; Austin <EOS>
<BOS> The objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware. This is a much more serious issue: <EOS>
<BOS> Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Remembering Stephen Hawking, a renowned physicist and ambassador of science. His theories unlocked a universe of possibilities that we &amp; the world are exploring. May you keep flying like superman in microgravity, as you said to astronauts on  in 2014 <EOS>
<BOS> Words are a very lossy compression of thought <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, this is a high priority <EOS>
<BOS> Throwing out some skit ideas for SNL. What should I do? <EOS>
<BOS> You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber. <EOS>
<BOS> All that was left were broken bots &amp; equipment hardly worth the scrap metal value. But we scrounged up spare parts, fixed the trusty old bots &amp; brought the factory back to life. <EOS>
<BOS> What does the future hodl? <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Feeling Lucky (Google tribute!) or Hungry are 100% intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner. If location has destination chargers, that's a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. This will be hit &amp; miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time. <EOS>
<BOS> Haha thanks :) <EOS>
<BOS> Reminder to buy our S3XY cars before midnight on Monday! Prices rise slightly worldwide on Tuesday. You can order online at <EOS>
<BOS> Adding people in next version <EOS>
<BOS> Much appreciated <EOS>
<BOS> Teslainventory Coming soon <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds about right <EOS>
<BOS> RT  That  letter to  should be tossed in the trash. Tesla Should Proudly Claim #Model3 Is Safest Car Ever Tested By NHTSA  via <EOS>
<BOS> Place your bets ... <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Deployment of DSX confirmed! <EOS>
<BOS> The cat videos are awesome <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV  Tesla  It will start out slow to make sure there are no corner case issues and then, if that looks good, speed up next week. We def need to add a \Request Latest Update\ feature! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes, very helpful. Thanks all beta testers! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla is the safest car according to US govt testing <EOS>
<BOS> They will <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that's a lot of complexity. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD <EOS>
<BOS> One of many reasons that we need to make life multiplanetary! <EOS>
<BOS> Dam now rly want choc chip muffin <EOS>
<BOS> They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something that's ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy. <EOS>

<BOS> Got it <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: [?] <EOS>
<BOS> As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths &amp; suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness &amp; according to specifications from the dive team leader. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslaownerssv  Sure <EOS>
<BOS> RT  \Buying a car today is an investment into the future. I think the most profound thing is that if you buy a Tesla today, I believe you are buying an appreciating asset - not a depreciating asset (due to the self-driving AI).\ <EOS>
<BOS> Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon. <EOS>
<BOS> No highs, no lows, only Doge <EOS>
<BOS> Similar problem with US data <EOS>
<BOS> Gaseous CH4/O2 &amp; heavy duty spark plugs. Basically, a  of insane power <EOS>
<BOS> Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Reddit is hardcore. Mostly correct analysis. Comments so dark ... <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Yeah, most reflights ever! <EOS>
<BOS> Working in the factory <EOS>
<BOS> Teslamodel3fan Oh. They have nice pictures there. <EOS>
<BOS> Great analysis <EOS>
<BOS> Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput. <EOS>
<BOS> Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1 <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX   Thanks for taking a chance on SpaceX so many years ago! Looking forward to using the new Iridium constellation. <EOS>
<BOS> Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k. <EOS>
<BOS> Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla SpaceX    That would probably mean civilization is doing great, although depends on assumptions for inflation haha <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe wise to bring it just in case <EOS>
<BOS> Starship is coming together! <EOS>
<BOS> But we probably won't try for best lap time this week, as we need to review &amp; tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nurburgring, especially Flugplatz section <EOS>

<BOS> Remove <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, I super loved astronomy (but took it at Queens, not Penn)! Definitely one of my favorite classes. Senior year quantum mechanics at Penn was the hardest class I ever took. That stuff will mess with your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> Pretty much <EOS>
<BOS> What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output. <EOS>
<BOS> Inconceivable! Who'd say a thing like that!? <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Telemetry indicates soft touchdown on the water, so fairing might still be reusable <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Sure <EOS>
<BOS> Sandwich time travel is the only explanation <EOS>
<BOS> Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap \maintain\ &amp; your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked. <EOS>
<BOS> Happy to support <EOS>
<BOS> Small detail, but each one will come with a serial number from 1 to 20,000 <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV Sure <EOS>
<BOS> That species has stood the test of time <EOS>
<BOS> Not sure yet, but hopefully. Will need leg &amp; other repairs. Probably SN6 flies before SN5. We need to make flights simple &amp; easy -- many per day. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes. Working through regulatory approvals. <EOS>
<BOS> Probably Starlink  &amp; some fun things <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaGong  TeslaownersSV Tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road!

<BOS> Thank you for your kind words, brother <EOS>
<BOS> I sure hope so! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant \Interim Health Officer\ of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party. <EOS>

<BOS> First 60 SpaceX Starlink satellites loaded into Falcon fairing. Tight fit. <EOS>
<BOS> No problem, we can buff it out <EOS>
<BOS> My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we're private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity's SpaceX investment. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla commercial solar ordering now live at <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It's what they do. <EOS>
<BOS> It is time to create a mecha <EOS>
<BOS> This sounds great <EOS>
<BOS> Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That's scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big. <EOS>
<BOS> His sick beats <EOS>

<BOS> All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX <EOS>
<BOS> True, it sounds so surreal, but the negative propaganda is still all out there &amp; easy to find in social media &amp; press interviews, so it's not just our imagination! <EOS>
<BOS> Your DLC is $$$$ <EOS>
<BOS> Anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. If they're evolving rapidly, something's up. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon <EOS>
<BOS> Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities ... <EOS>
<BOS> That's quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate  irony haha. <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: .Teslaownersau created a charging network across Australia so you can travel from your home to P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way in a single charge: <EOS>
<BOS> I am not <EOS>
<BOS> Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that's a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply. <EOS>

<BOS> RT  . and SpaceX are standing down from today's #CrewDragon In-Flight Abort test due to poor splashdown and recovery weather.  The demonstration is now targeted for Sunday, Jan. 19. The six-hour launch window will open at 8am ET. <EOS>
<BOS> I feel like this sometimes <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1. <EOS>
<BOS> Hypernominalization <EOS>
<BOS> Love the space cowboy esthetic <EOS>
<BOS> Because blue <EOS>
<BOS> But ya know what, let's test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let's hold a vote &amp; find out. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX     Mass to orbit is a more accurate metric than # of launches, although should be orbit-adjusted (eg GTO&gt;LEO), which would increase competitor mass numbers <EOS>
<BOS> Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard? <EOS>
<BOS> So it goes <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatever's most fun! <EOS>
<BOS> Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslamodel3fan Maybe we can buffer enough of it onboard. Will check. <EOS>
<BOS> Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy's claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features. <EOS>

<BOS> Certain regulatory agencies would beg to differ <EOS>
<BOS> When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you'll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car. <EOS>

<BOS> True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time. <EOS>
<BOS> According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It's not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter. <EOS>

<BOS> SpaceX  Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel. <EOS>

<BOS> That was a DM, right? <EOS>
<BOS> Ancient Egypt had an incredible esthetic that stands to this day <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, you're ignorant. Don't remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law &amp; land you in jail. I didn't review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please. <EOS>
<BOS> Buying a car in 2019 that can't upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in 1919 <EOS>
<BOS> Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc. <EOS>
<BOS> Falcon was 25% of successful orbital launches in 2020, but maybe a majority of payload to orbit. Anyone done the math? <EOS>

<BOS> SpaceX   He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage. <EOS>

<BOS> No, but it's mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6) <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaMotorsClub Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe. <EOS>
<BOS> Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it's going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience. <EOS>

<BOS> That's a great one <EOS>
<BOS> Good point <EOS>
<BOS> Had no money to invest in Zip2, but my founder equity yielded ~$15M after tax. Of that, I rolled ~$10M into PayPal, which yielded ~$180M, then ...   Basic principle is that I would not ask investors to risk money on my company if I would not also do so. <EOS>

<BOS> SpaceX Maybe this should be the flag of Mars <EOS>
<BOS> Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time. <EOS>
<BOS> Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should. <EOS>
<BOS> Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world's factories every day <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes. It will even float for a while. <EOS>

<BOS> Listening to Revolutions by Duncan   Found this on a throw pillow ... <EOS>
<BOS> Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It's stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don't do it justice. <EOS>
<BOS> Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date &amp; over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating &amp; virus will exceed mass of known universe! <EOS>

<BOS> Maybe helpful <EOS>
<BOS> No, that's the other guy <EOS>
<BOS> Considering <EOS>
<BOS> Non, je ne regrette meme <EOS>
<BOS> These would be road tunnels for zero emissions vehicles only -- no toxic fumes is the key. Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies). This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX It's all the \secondary\ structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe <EOS>
<BOS> Perhaps slightly more confident, but it's essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic. <EOS>
<BOS> Space Jam should've won the Oscar <EOS>
<BOS> Approximately, log(rate) <EOS>

<BOS> He was critical of large bureaucracies &amp; Napoleon III was indeed a knucklehead <EOS>
<BOS> Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there's no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here. <EOS>

<BOS> Congrats to NIO. That is a tough milestone. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslacharts It's a hard problem, mostly due to esthetics, but it's the future we should have <EOS>
<BOS> Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn't blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval. <EOS>
<BOS> Indeed, very simple question. To be specific:  did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, not so bad <EOS>
<BOS> Classifying all deaths as corona even if corona didn't cause the death is simply a lie <EOS>

<BOS> If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.  A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.   Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars. <EOS>
<BOS> Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by SpaceX engine/test team! <EOS>
<BOS> Coming in hot <EOS>
<BOS> Starship propellant is ~78% oxygen, so an O2 plant on the moon would be enough. Otherwise, we could brute-force it with tankers to low Earth orbit. That's probably faster. <EOS>
<BOS> Over a million combustion engine (it's right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right. <EOS>
