<BOS> Michael \Gigachad\ Saylor <EOS>
<BOS> Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke! <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX You're welcome <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Finally got my Tesla Model 3! Best car buying experience of my life; only took 5 minutes, much better than the usual 7 hour dealship hell. Thank you  for the greatest car of all time! A masterpiece of engineering &amp; design! #model3 #tesla #atx #electricorgtfo <EOS>
<BOS> Red sky of Mars is Blue at dawn &amp; dusk <EOS>
<BOS> Printed on the circuit board of a car in deep space <EOS>
<BOS> Your server-side code is doing too much <EOS>
<BOS> New S &amp; X are much improved. Worth trying out. You're on version 2, current S/X is version 4. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it <EOS>
<BOS> Haha. Will post summary. <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Robotic refueling. 3D Forest imagery. And student experiments inspired by  \Guardians of the Galaxy.\ These are just a few of the  studies that will be added to the hundreds onboard the  with the SpaceX's Dec. 4 launch! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes <EOS>
<BOS> An acceptable percentage. Doge is much more concentrated. <EOS>
<BOS> Tonnage delivered to orbit, normalized to LEO, would be interesting to see <EOS>
<BOS> California HHS server crashed. Maybe it has covid. <EOS>
<BOS> Acquisition of signal expected in 5 mins <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it's very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles. <EOS>
<BOS> All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Falcon Heavy and STP-2 are vertical on Launch Complex 39A. Tonight's four-hour launch window opens at 11:30 p.m. EDT, or 3:30 UTC on June 25 - <EOS>
<BOS> They have the best merkins <EOS>
<BOS> Very sensible <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Some good ideas here! <EOS>
<BOS> We are tiny <EOS>

<BOS> Another government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people imo <EOS>
<BOS> The gerontocracy is out of touch with the people <EOS>
<BOS> Winning \worst person I've ever worked with\ is not easy. Some real champions are vying for that title! <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla It's still there, but focus is Vegas &amp; Prufrock, our new tunneling machine <EOS>
<BOS> It really does <EOS>
<BOS> Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won't be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great <EOS>
<BOS> What's actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. <EOS>
<BOS> Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Great name <EOS>
<BOS> That's the idea <EOS>
<BOS> Europe &amp; China timing will be announced soon <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaNY Sandy Munro knows what he's talking about <EOS>

<BOS> RT Tesla: When you finally meet a car who's into low maintenance relationships: <EOS>
<BOS> Rosetta by Vangelis is incredible <EOS>
<BOS> Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, we're working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won't be needed <EOS>
<BOS> The \early investor\ part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I've ever worked with and that's saying something!) for years. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Surprisingly difficult to address false positives with rain. System would go nuts trying to wipe away non-existent rain, which was obv ineffective. <EOS>
<BOS> NPCs all the way up <EOS>
<BOS> Most people don't know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China <EOS>
<BOS> Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering, eg no such thing as a \rocket scientist\, only rocket engineers. Latter is who put humans on the moon. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX team in Hawthorne control, Dragon docked to Station above <EOS>

<BOS> Critical test launch before flying astronauts is green for Jan 18 <EOS>
<BOS> It's about time I suppose <EOS>
<BOS> You have my full support! <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: Staying Public <EOS>
<BOS> If Reich actually cares about global warming, why is he making so much hot air!? <EOS>
<BOS> Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that's needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> But actually ... <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave <EOS>
<BOS> It's a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV A few more revisions needed. Probably Beta 10 or 11. <EOS>
<BOS> The most entertaining outcome is the most likely <EOS>
<BOS> Just one stipulation on sale: I own Gene Wilder's old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any its soul. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla I'm excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors, plus Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson as legal advisors, on the proposal to take Tesla private <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: Just surpassed 200k Powerwall installs globally [?] <EOS>
<BOS> We just got approval to open a new Supercharger station in Malibu! <EOS>
<BOS> Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable. <EOS>
<BOS> These rumors are untrue! <EOS>
<BOS> End Titles from Blade Runner played after Model Y webcast cut <EOS>

<BOS> Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Jay *really* knows cars! Next-level. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers <EOS>

<BOS> Good chance it accelerates viral vaccines &amp; cures <EOS>
<BOS> We don't judge. Any pic you want! <EOS>
<BOS> A metaphor for life <EOS>
<BOS> Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla This is out of our hands, so hard to predict. Maybe on order of 10 billion km of real world driving will be enough to convince regulators. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I'm going to build a moat &amp; fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite ... <EOS>
<BOS> No it doesn't hurt at all <EOS>
<BOS> So many saved drafts. So ... so many. <EOS>

<BOS> I was just out at the launch pad. Connector damaged in the storm, but fixed now. Might be able to fire tonight or at least get to the next issue. <EOS>
<BOS> ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights <EOS>
<BOS> Starlink vertical on the pad <EOS>
<BOS> Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow. <EOS>
<BOS> That's odd. Will look into it. <EOS>
<BOS> Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It's like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will. <EOS>
<BOS> But, occasionally, the metal version <EOS>
<BOS> I've just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest &amp; yet believe that same public is too stupid &amp; immoral to assess their credibility. It's amazing that you don't understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow. <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: The booster supporting this mission previously flew in support of the Telstar 19 VANTAGE and Es'hail-2 missions <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. <EOS>
<BOS> RT  .SpaceX's #CrewDragon is in orbit, on its way to  Unlike the cargo Dragon, which is grappled by a robotic arm, this uncrewed test flight will dock autonomously.  Watch live at 3:30am ET to see the spacecraft's arrival at the station: <EOS>
<BOS> Not often these days. Good way to spend time with kids though. <EOS>
<BOS> init void <EOS>
<BOS> Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time. <EOS>
<BOS> They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there's nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don't want to. <EOS>

<BOS> Rage, rage against the dying of the light <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX 7 <EOS>
<BOS> Of course <EOS>
<BOS> Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized. <EOS>
<BOS> Cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. Falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing 12 months. <EOS>
<BOS> Interesting <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today. <EOS>
<BOS> Hard to predict dates right now. Most likely postponed to mid May. <EOS>
<BOS> Same hex tiles, slightly different mounting method. Need bigger sections of tiles to see how they hold up with cryo shrinkage, pressure expansion &amp; body bending. <EOS>
<BOS> Monty Python is amazing <EOS>
<BOS> Brave Starhopper carried the day <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_peter  Actually, we've made slight changes, but the range improvement is &gt;90% efficiency <EOS>
<BOS> It's a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity. <EOS>

<BOS> TeslaownersSV That's significantly improved in current production <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Danielle! <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV Update soon <EOS>
<BOS> Just learned that my physics prof from Penn is head of Fermilab &amp; still has some of my old homework [?] <EOS>
<BOS> Important news in a few hours ... <EOS>
<BOS> While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software.  Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it's hopeless. This is insanely hard. <EOS>
<BOS> The Tesla board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in 100+ years, despite many setbacks. Tesla owes its very existence to this board! <EOS>
<BOS> Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldn't resist) <EOS>

<BOS> That's ridiculous, lions can't vote, they don't even have opposable thumbs. Also, they'd need 61%, so no. <EOS>
<BOS> Dogecoin Mode <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Launch underway <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV   Please voice your disagreement as strongly as possible with <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati We really need a bigger one, so adults can squeeze in too. Guaranteed to make a party more fun. Works well with flamethrowers! <EOS>

<BOS> RT Teslarati: Tesla crushes Wall Street's Q2 estimates with over 90k deliveries $TSLA <EOS>
<BOS> Also, we get our lithium from Australia <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up &amp; operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system. <EOS>
<BOS> Obv just someone in a  suit. Also, very sus that a  is reporting on this. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Probably more accurate to say Great Filters plural. <EOS>
<BOS> Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla deliveries &amp; AP hardware chart by  at MIT <EOS>
<BOS> Interesting <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe melted an engine preburner or fuel hot gas manifold. Whatever it is caused pneumatics loss. We need to design out this problem. <EOS>
<BOS> It would appear that their calculations were incorrect <EOS>
<BOS> Already fixed <EOS>
<BOS> A cool thing about the design is that's easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all <EOS>

<BOS> strikes again! <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX  The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC &amp; differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever. <EOS>

<BOS> BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. It's time people knew. <EOS>
<BOS> Dojo isn't needed, but will make self-driving better. It isn't enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately, it's hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to  to add solar to an existing roof &amp;  for a new roof with integrated solar. <EOS>
<BOS> ~1000, as all seats would be \coach\ &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It's basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands. <EOS>
<BOS> Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a subject of much debate <EOS>
<BOS> Will be amazing to see it in operation! Biggest casting machine ever made. Will make rear body in a single piece, including crash rails. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Glad SpaceX could help! We are prioritizing emergency responders &amp; locations with no Internet connectivity at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Haha yes <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us! <EOS>
<BOS> This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg. <EOS>
<BOS> Just go through resonant modes fast. It's when you hang out there that problems arise. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslatino Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates &amp; make it last for years. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX At least 10X cheaper <EOS>

<BOS> RT Teslarati: LIVESTREAM of SpaceX Starhopper 150m Test Flight set for today, following FAA clearance <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, that would be quite a trip! <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy. <EOS>
<BOS> Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you're in an air tube, time doesn't matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections. <EOS>
<BOS> Vicious torque <EOS>
<BOS> Fair point <EOS>
<BOS> Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now. <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Last launch of 2020 coming up <EOS>
<BOS> How come Hulk never loses pants!? <EOS>
<BOS> We're building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production. <EOS>

<BOS> Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe &amp; China! Most insane logistics challenge I've ever seen. Thanks also to many country &amp; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated. <EOS>
<BOS> Wizard alien [?] <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate. <EOS>
<BOS> Haha awesome <EOS>
<BOS> The Boring Company will be using dirt from tunnel digging to create bricks for low cost housing <EOS>
<BOS> Similar, but seemingly small changes can have surprisingly big effects <EOS>
<BOS> Looks cool <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor. <EOS>
<BOS> Not SpaceX <EOS>
<BOS> 1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left! <EOS>
<BOS> Congrats! <EOS>
<BOS> Probably 5 or 6 with an optimized tanker, although filling up the ship in orbit isn't required for Mars, so 4 is possible <EOS>
<BOS> You'll see <EOS>
<BOS> Max Tegmark is great <EOS>
<BOS> Just left Zeebrugge, now Tilburg, then Tesla HQ in Amsterdam &amp; Oslo tonight to review service in Norway. Exciting to see thousands of Model 3's on their way to owners in Europe! <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: 1/ In 2018 we added over 3,100 Superchargers globally. Our network now covers 99% of the US population and 97% of Europe and will continue to grow in 2019 <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Deployment of 60 Starlink satellites confirmed <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: \Track Mode left me literally shaking with adrenaline\ <EOS>
<BOS> Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don't realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return. <EOS>
<BOS> Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven. <EOS>

<BOS> Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it's worth, he has my support. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations. <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know. <EOS>
<BOS> If Tesla owners are \conspiracy theorists\, then it would be fair to call them \advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers\.   If that's an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths ... <EOS>
<BOS> Gathering input this week, will begin taking action next week and let people know how they can help <EOS>
<BOS> Out on launch pad, engine swap underway <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly. He plays the \poor inventor\ card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent. <EOS>
<BOS> With steel membrane wings like a Dragon, we may be able to lower Starship's orbital reentry temp to ~1000 degrees C, which would allow the whole surface to be uncooled bare metal <EOS>
<BOS> !! Will take action. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive. <EOS>

<BOS> Tesla I was trying to channel Herb Tarlek from WKRP <EOS>
<BOS> Good analysis. Both computers will be used &amp; sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon &amp; say who's the pet now ... <EOS>
<BOS> The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling. <EOS>
<BOS> We've always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties. <EOS>
<BOS> No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class \lords &amp; commoners\ system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't get the little ship thing. You can't show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing. <EOS>

<BOS> Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread. <EOS>
<BOS> Terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime. However, we can establish a human base there in our lifetime. At least a future spacefaring civilization - discovering our ruins - will be impressed humans got that far. <EOS>

<BOS> Will check with our cat, Schrodinger, but I don't think she's going to like it <EOS>
<BOS> And cases with high (non-infectious) Ct should quarantine for a few days, while getting another test. Second test determines whether they're just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards, where viral fragments exist, but person is not infectious. <EOS>

<BOS> Teslarati No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated. <EOS>
<BOS> Universe is big, but rendering complexity is not <EOS>
<BOS> Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life. <EOS>

<BOS> Don't make me bite my thumb at you <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla TeslaSchweiz Ok <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  Exactly. Also, you can't actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds. <EOS>
<BOS> Prototypes are easy, volume production is hard, positive cash flow is  excruciating <EOS>

<BOS> \Nano\ is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would've been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output. <EOS>
<BOS> 5 years ago. We need to accelerate progress towards fully reusable rockets. Cost per ton to orbit needs to improve by &gt;1000% from where Falcon is today for there to be a self-sustaining city on Mars. <EOS>

<BOS> I don't want be cavalier, but there isn't an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, dual motor AWD is super fun! <EOS>
<BOS> There have been hundreds of improvements to fit &amp; finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past. <EOS>
<BOS> Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders. <EOS>
<BOS> Games &amp; other refinements will go to all Tesla S, X &amp; 3 from start of production. Autopilot enhancements apply to all Model 3's plus S &amp; X made in last few years (needs Autopilot Hardware V2.0 or higher). <EOS>

<BOS> Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed. <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Each second, 1.5 million tons of solar material shoot off the Sun into space. The magnetosphere shields Earth, but the solar wind can get in near the poles and disrupt satellite, radio &amp; GPS signals. 3 new missions aim to improve this technology problem: <EOS>

<BOS> Astronaut launch today! <EOS>
<BOS> San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality.

<BOS> Can't wait to bring Tesla to Brazil. One of my favorite countries! <EOS>
<BOS> Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez ... <EOS>
<BOS> Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you tried a hydrophobic spray? <EOS>
<BOS> Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020. <EOS>
<BOS> If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing &amp; the tutorial is way too long <EOS>
<BOS> The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather <EOS>

<BOS> Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in '93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed. <EOS>
<BOS> We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It's not a question of money. If there was a \great engineer\ factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build. <EOS>
<BOS> Boys High is a government school for anyone local, which we were <EOS>

<BOS> Python <EOS>
<BOS> 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children's toys? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them. <EOS>
<BOS> But actual road data is what matters most <EOS>

<BOS> Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati I tried to warn them ... <EOS>
<BOS> No problem :) <EOS>
<BOS> The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it's a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks. <EOS>

<BOS> Asimov's Foundation books should def be part of the mission. They're amazing. <EOS>
<BOS> China's progress in advanced infrastructure is more than 100 times faster than the US <EOS>
<BOS> [?][?] <EOS>
<BOS> It's the best <EOS>
<BOS> His son sounds great btw <EOS>
<BOS> RT  First grid fin has been removed from the 3x flown Falcon 9 standing at port of LA. Been wanting to see this happen for years. So NEAT! #spacex Teslarati <EOS>
<BOS> Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude! <EOS>
<BOS> On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%. <EOS>
<BOS> 8.5 bar <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to  Plum Brook vacuum chamber <EOS>
<BOS> Uhh, hello, I need to build cars <EOS>
<BOS> We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable. <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: RVac and sea level Raptor with a human for scale <EOS>
<BOS> Strange, as SpaceX lands on land frequently. Russia has very talented engineers, but they must be given reusability as goal or success is impossible. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla_addicted   Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that's problematic above ~30 deg latitude. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Or Y <EOS>
<BOS> Sure <EOS>
<BOS> We will ask the regulators <EOS>
<BOS> at 5M views after 36 hours. Congrats to Chris Paine &amp; co! <EOS>
<BOS> Knee deep <EOS>
<BOS> Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it's designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year <EOS>
<BOS> Lot on our plate, so it's either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster. <EOS>
<BOS> Renewable energy is happening fast <EOS>
<BOS> Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April. <EOS>
<BOS> I kind of agree about TikTok tho <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: Model 3 is now the best-selling mid-sized premium sedan in the USA <EOS>
<BOS> Just meeting with Larry Ellison to seek some advice. Back working on Tesla end of quarter tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Not currently in V10, but will try <EOS>
<BOS> Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency <EOS>
<BOS> Empty article? <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software. <EOS>
<BOS> Come work at the biggest &amp; most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free. <EOS>
<BOS> Teslanomicsco  TeslaClubSweden !! Unnecessary characters. Will change. <EOS>
<BOS> For sure <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: Tesla Grid Controller and Powerpacks optimize renewable energy across Samoa's grid <EOS>
<BOS> I'm staying at a friend's place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall.   When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don't even flicker. Owner says he doesn't notice. <EOS>
<BOS> Sorry <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla <EOS>
<BOS> Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don't try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever. <EOS>
<BOS> 46k limited edition boring hats sold, 4K to go. Then flamethrower. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like a good idea <EOS>
<BOS> Design &amp; production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible <EOS>
<BOS> Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications. <EOS>
<BOS> Duck emoji FTW <EOS>
<BOS> What's cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord <EOS>
<BOS> Will consider <EOS>
<BOS> Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big <EOS>
<BOS> Sure, will call tomorrow <EOS>
<BOS> Liquid nitrogen cryogenic strength test underway [?] <EOS>
<BOS> Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I'm against science is like saying Beyonce doesn't know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue. <EOS>
<BOS> RT SpaceX: Crew Dragon separating from Falcon 9 during today's test, which verified the spacecraft's ability to carry astronauts to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent <EOS>
<BOS> We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission <EOS>
<BOS> RT  From what I gather, Tesla was told they could operate by the state of CA but Alameda County illegally overrode that decision.  can you confirm? People are so quick to jump to conclusions but it's good to remember there's usually more behind the scenes. <EOS>
<BOS> The Spice Flows <EOS>
<BOS> Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing.   Note: word \Beta\ is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams. <EOS>
<BOS> Just saw that on a T-shirt  competition <EOS>
<BOS> SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11. <EOS>
<BOS> Please buff Torb's turret! <EOS>
<BOS> Bold move, sir, bold move <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, Model 3 is designed to fit 6'4\  adults comfortably in both front &amp; rear seats at same time <EOS>
<BOS> On Tuesday, SpaceX will attempt to fly both an orbital rocket and spacecraft for the first time.... <EOS>
<BOS> RT  I really love my Tesla. I'm in the future. Thank you Elon. <EOS>
<BOS> Should be a lot of fun! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  Why? <EOS>
<BOS> RT  After years of research, scientists have confirmed that liquid water exists on Mars. This could allow humans to further explore the red planet. <EOS>
<BOS> For sure! When doing US govt crash safety testing, the Model S roof was so strong, it broke their testing machine. <EOS>
<BOS> No such thing as a \full refresh\ at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence. <EOS>
<BOS> There's a bit more to it than that <EOS>
<BOS> More fun, less shun! <EOS>
<BOS> Twitter is so dark ... <EOS>
<BOS> Aloha, welcome back from space <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Also, we need to be better at remembering brightness settings. <EOS>
<BOS> 155mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only 5 offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to 31mph. <EOS>
<BOS> Our main engineering locations are Palo Alto, Austin &amp; Seattle, but working remotely is acceptable for exceptional candidates <EOS>
<BOS> RT  Tesla Model 3 sedan aces all of U.S. safety agency's crash tests <EOS>
<BOS> New York seeing same results for invasive ventilators as Wuhan <EOS>
<BOS> According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages <EOS>
<BOS> We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July. <EOS>
<BOS> I literally have the receipts!! This is so dumb. <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla owner shows how well ultrawhite seats hold up after 25,000 miles. The black &amp; white interior is def best imo. <EOS>
<BOS> True, that was pretty impressive <EOS>
<BOS> One of the best games ever <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceXStarlink SpaceX Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Teslarati  Might try to refly SN15 soon <EOS>
<BOS> RT Tesla: oh wait we already do <EOS>
<BOS> Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.  Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster. <EOS>
<BOS> H2O, CH4/CO2, N2, iron, nickel, chrome, aluminum (not necessarily in that order) will matter far more than gold or platinum for space travel <EOS>
<BOS> Opposite is true: you can have 100's of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla We're making progress. Improved rules are going through the EU standards committees. Hopefully better in a few months. <EOS>
<BOS> Tunnels aren't required for this, but might be the only realistic way to solve for downtown to downtown travel <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly <EOS>
<BOS> pravda <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaTested Yes, coming soon <EOS>
<BOS> All things in moderation, especially etymology <EOS>
<BOS> Turns out there's more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined <EOS>
<BOS> Life is made of ups &amp; downs <EOS>
<BOS> [?][?] Tesla Autopilot/AI team [?][?] <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceXcentric  SpaceX That's the number that really matters <EOS>
<BOS> SpaceX SpaceX team is doing great work! One day, the true measure of success will be that Starship flights are commonplace. <EOS>
<BOS> Uh oh <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  Note is much appreciated <EOS>
<BOS> Will do Starship presentation a few weeks after Hopper hovers, so prob late July. If that timing works, free LJ chips for all present! <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla  True <EOS>
<BOS> Congratulations! <EOS>
<BOS> Reality is its own parrot parody <EOS>
<BOS> TeslaownersSV  Sure :) <EOS>
<BOS> Effectively throttles via tight impulse width control &amp; hundreds of small firings <EOS>
<BOS> Look, at least it's not the Magellanic Clouds. They're basically next door. <EOS>
<BOS> Um  this word Turbo does not mean what you think it does <EOS>
<BOS> Choc milk is even better than people remember. It's incredible. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km. <EOS>
<BOS> Sagan was awesome <EOS>
<BOS> Twitter thought I got hacked &amp; locked my account haha <EOS>
<BOS> Tesla holiday software update has FSD sneak preview, Stardew Valley, Lost Backgammon &amp; a few other things <EOS>
<BOS> No, I just think you're a boring idiot <EOS>
